# LingGym

## Overview

LingGym is a new benchmark that evaluates LLMs’ capacity for metalinguistic reasoning using Interlinear Glossed Text (IGT) and grammatical descriptions extracted from 18 typologically diverse reference grammars. Our work is presented in [LingGym: How Far Are LLMs from Thinking Like Field Linguists?](https://aclanthology.org/2025.emnlp-main.69//)

In this github repo. We release three types of datasets:

1. Benchmark data (Main): the complete multiple choice dataset used for benchmark evaluation.

2. CSV files: extracted examples and explanations from grammar books.

3. IGT files: all IGT-format data extracted from grammar books.


The benchmark data is also available in Hugging Face: [LINK](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cyang33/LingGym//)

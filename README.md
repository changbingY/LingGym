# LingGym

## Overview

LingGym is a benchmark dataset with three file types:

CSV files: extracted examples and explanations from grammar books.

Benchmark data: the complete dataset used for benchmark evaluation (done).

IGT files: all IGT-format data extracted from grammar books.

I will continue to update all files and code during the next two weeks.

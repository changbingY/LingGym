# LingGym

## Overview

LingGym is a new benchmark that evaluates LLMs’ capacity for metalinguistic reasoning using Interlinear Glossed Text (IGT) and grammatical descriptions extracted from 18 typologically diverse reference grammars.

In this github repo. We release three types of datasets:

1. Benchmark data (Main): the complete multiple choice dataset used for benchmark evaluation.

2. CSV files: extracted examples and explanations from grammar books.

3. IGT files: all IGT-format data extracted from grammar books.

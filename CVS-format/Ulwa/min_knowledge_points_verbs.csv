Verbs\label{sec:4,,,,,"This chapter is dedicated to the description and analysis of verbs in Ulwa. Verbs constitute the \isi{part of speech} that exhibits the most \isi{inflection}, variability, and irregularity. Non-verbal lexemes may function like verbs (that is, they may occur at the end of a clause and fulfill the role of \isi{predicate} of the clause), but only true, underived verbs receive \isi{verbal morphology}. Verbs in Ulwa are thus the words that can be \isi{inflect}ed for the full range of \isi{tense}-\isi{aspect}-\isi{mood} (\isi{TAM}) distinctions in the language \REF{ex:verbs:1a}.\footnote{Here and throughout the book, the abbreviation “\isi{TAM}” is used, largely due to its ubiquity in contemporary grammatical description. \isi{Tense}, however, plays a minimal role in Ulwa \isi{verbal inflection}. Verbs are primary \isi{inflect}ed for distinctions in \isi{aspect} and \isi{mood} (\sectref{sec:4.2}).}",ex:verbs:1a,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Verbs\label{sec:4,,,,,"There is no \isi{morphological} indexing of subjects (i.e., S or A arguments) on verbs. \isi{Transitive} verbs, however, may be preceded by an \isi{object-marker} \isi{proclitic} (\sectref{sec:7.2}), which may index \isi{direct object}s (i.e., P arguments) \REF{ex:verbs:1b}. These markers can occur with verbs marked for any \isi{TAM} category; they can occur both in \isi{positive} and in \isi{negative} sentences. No \isi{animacy} distinction is found in verbs: \isi{animate} and \isi{inanimate} P arguments are indexed alike.",ex:verbs:1b,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Verbs\label{sec:4,The verb stem\label{sec:4.1,,,,"Monomorphemic verbs in Ulwa (i.e., verbs that are not \isi{compound}s), are generally \isi{disyllabic} or, less commonly, \isi{monosyllabic}. \isi{Verb stem}s generally end in \isi{vowel}s \REF{ex:verbs:1d}.",ex:verbs:1d,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Verbs\label{sec:4,The verb stem\label{sec:4.1,,,,"However, for most verbs, this final \isi{vowel} is lost in the \isi{imperfective} form, which takes the \isi{suffix} \textit{{}-e} ‘\textsc{ipfv}’. There is also a small set of verbs that end in \isi{consonant}s. Interestingly, these verbs almost all belong to the same \isi{semantic} domain of cutting, splitting, breaking, and so on \REF{ex:verbs:1e}.",ex:verbs:1e,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Verbs\label{sec:4,The verb stem\label{sec:4.1,,,,"Some ‘breaking’ verbs may derive from collocations with the \isi{indefinite} marker ko= ‘\textsc{indf}’.\footnote{Thus, for example, kol- ‘break’ < ko= ‘\textsc{indf}’ + l[ï]- ‘put’ (i.e., ‘put a [piece]’), or kot- ‘break' < ko= ‘\textsc{indf}’ + t[ï]- ‘take’ (i.e., ‘take a [piece]’). This \isi{compound}ing is in part suggested by the fact that Ulwa generally lost \ili{Proto-Keram} *k- when word-initial in \isi{polysyllabic} words, but preserved it in \isi{monosyllabic} forms, such as ko= ‘\textsc{indf}’. Also, it should be noted that the verb kot- ‘break, bear’ is analyzed here as ending in /t-/ (and not \textsuperscript{†}/ï-/), despite often exhibiting the \isi{perfective} form [kotïp] and the \isi{irrealis} form [kotïna]. The presence of [ï] in these forms, however, is taken to be \isi{phonetic}ally motivated -- that is, it is an \isi{epenthetic} \isi{vowel} breaking up the \isi{consonant cluster}. Indeed, this \isi{vowel} can be avoided in the \isi{perfective} form in instances in which the /tp/ sequences can be broken across a \isi{syllable} boundary (e.g., in the \isi{dependent-marked} form [kot.pe]). Moreover, the \isi{conditional} form of the verb kot- ‘break, bear’ is [kota] (not \textsuperscript{†}[kotïta]), from underlying /kot-ta/ -- in other words, instead of acquiring an \isi{epenthetic} \isi{vowel}, the /tt/ sequence simply \isi{degeminate}s (\sectref{sec:2.5.8}).} Surprisingly (given the \isi{phonotactics} of the language), the verb kamb- ‘shun’\footnote{Also its \is{derivation} derivatives ala-kamb- ‘dislike’ and na-kamb- ‘suffice’.} seems to have an underlying stem-final \isi{voiced} \isi{stop} (\sectref{sec:2.1.2}). In addition to the verbs in \REF{ex:verbs:1e}, the verb ina- ‘get’ seems to have an alternate \isi{consonant}-final stem /in-/, which is used in the \isi{irrealis} form [inda] (< /in-nda/). The \isi{locative verb} p- ‘be, be at’, whose stem also ends in a \isi{consonant} (indeed it consists entirely of a single \isi{consonant}), is discussed at the end of \sectref{sec:4.3}.",ex:verbs:1e,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Verbs\label{sec:4,Basic verbal morphology\label{sec:4.2,,,,"There is a basic three-way distinction in \isi{TAM} in Ulwa, reflected in the choice of verbal \isi{suffix}.

It is sometimes ambiguous which of these \isi{suffix}es is marking a given verb or, indeed, whether both are underlyingly present on the same verb, since the double \isi{vowel} sequence /ee/ would reduce to [e] in any case. However, at least with verbs with an irregular \isi{imperfective} \isi{suffix} (\sectref{sec:4.3}), it is clear that the two morphemes can co-occur \REF{ex:verbs:1g}.",ex:verbs:1g,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although \isi{stem}-final \isi{vowel}s are never lost before /p/, there is one notable \isi{phonological} change that occurs in certain \isi{verb stem}s before the \isi{perfective} \isi{suffix} \textit{{}-p} ‘\textsc{pfv}’, a change that has a rather specific conditioning environment. Namely, the \is{high vowel} high \isi{central vowel} /ï/ is lowered to [a] when immediately following the \isi{voiceless} \isi{velar} \isi{stop} and immediately preceding the \isi{voiceless} \isi{bilabial} \isi{stop} \REF{ex:verbs:2}.",ex:verbs:2,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whatever the \isi{phonetic} motivation, however, this alternation is quite regular, as illustrated by \isi{irrealis} verb forms that have [nd] after a preceding \isi{sonorant} \isi{consonant}s /l, n, m, w, y/ \REF{ex:verbs:4}.",ex:verbs:4,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

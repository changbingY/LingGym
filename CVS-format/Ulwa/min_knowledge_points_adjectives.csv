Such \isi{adnominal adjective}s never occur outside the NP (i.e., \isi{discontinuous}ly).

While some speakers consider this order to be ungrammatical (perhaps an influence from the \isi{word order} of \ili{Tok Pisin}; see \chapref{sec:15}), it nevertheless occurs in speech, thereby making it difficult to rely on the distributional criterion that adjectives follow nouns.

Adjectives\label{sec:5,Relationship to other word classes\label{sec:5.4,,,,"The \isi{morphosyntactic} similarity between nouns and adjectives also makes it difficult at times to assign certain words to one class or the other.

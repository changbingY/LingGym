Although this could be taken to suggest that there exist no truly \isi{transitive} verbs in Ulwa, an alternative view would be that at least some instances in which a putatively \isi{ambitransitive} verb occurs without an overtly expressed object are examples of \is{object deletion} \isi{indefinite object deletion} (\citealt[124--125]{Næss2007}). For example, the verb ama- ‘eat’ may occur either with \REF{ex:syntax:294} or without \REF{ex:syntax:295} an expressed object; when no object is stated, however, it could be argued that there is an \isi{indefinite} object (i.e., ‘food’) that has simply been deleted.\footnote{Crosslinguistically, the verb ‘eat’ often behaves idiosyncratically in terms of \isi{transitivity} \citep{Næss2009}. Thus, it should perhaps not be taken as indicating too much about \isi{transitivity} in the language in general. Nevertheless, Ulwa may here be contrasted with other \ili{Keram} languages, such as \ili{Mwakai} and \ili{Ap Ma}, in which the \isi{semantic}ally light noun si ‘things’ (in both languages) is commonly used as the object of the verb ‘eat’ when no particular food is being specified. Thus, in contrast to its sister languages, Ulwa -- or at least the \ili{Manu} \isi{dialect} of Ulwa -- seems to have an \isi{ambitransitive} verb meaning ‘eat’. In the \ili{Maruat-Dimiri-Yaul} \isi{dialect}, on the other hand, ‘eat’ generally takes the object mundï ‘food’, when no particular food is being specified. Although contrasts such as the one exemplified by \REF{ex:syntax:294} and \REF{ex:syntax:295} suggest the possible \isi{ambitransitivity} (namely, \isi{A-lability}) of the verb ‘eat’, it is common in the \ili{Manu} \isi{dialect} for the \isi{detransitivizing} \isi{prefix} na- \textsc{‘detr’} to occur with ‘eat’ when no particular food is being specified (\sectref{sec:13.8.2}).}",ex:syntax:294,\gsrc Nï ta lamndu amap. | \gll nï ta lamndu ama-p | \gls 1SG already pig eat-PFV | \glt `I have already eaten pork.’,ex:syntax:295,\gsrc Nï ta amap. | \gll nï ta ama-p | \gls 1SG already eat-PFV | \glt `I have already eaten.’,ex:syntax:294,\gsrc Nï ta lamndu amap. | \gll nï ta lamndu ama-p | \gls 1SG already pig eat-PFV | \glt `I have already eaten pork.’,ex:syntax:295,\gsrc Nï ta amap. | \gll nï ta ama-p | \gls 1SG already eat-PFV | \glt `I have already eaten.’,,,,,,,,,,,,

In examples \REF{ex:syntax:387} through \REF{ex:syntax:391}, all translated with ‘want’, the \isi{irrealis} verb forms could, in other contexts, impart other meanings (e.g., ‘will’, ‘should’, ‘can’, etc.; see \sectref{sec:4.6}).",ex:syntax:387,\gsrc Nï lamndu \textbf{mawalinda}. | \gll nï lamndu ma=wali-\textbf{nda} | \gls 1SG pig 3SG.OBJ=hit-IRR | \glt `I want to kill a pig.’,ex:syntax:391,\gsrc Nï ango wa \textbf{lunda}. | \gll nï ango wa lo-\textbf{nda} | \gls 1SG NEG village go-IRR | \glt `I don’t want to go around in villages.’,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

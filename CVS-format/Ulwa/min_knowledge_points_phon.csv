Phonetics and phonology\label{sec:2,Consonants\label{sec:2.1,"Prenasalized voiced stops /mb, nd, ng/\label{sec:2.1.2",,,"There are several reasons for treating these complex articulations as single phonemes, rather than as sequences of \isi{nasal}-plus-\isi{stop}. First, no \isi{voiced} \isi{stop} ever occurs without a preceding \isi{nasal} (although a \isi{nasal} may appear without any adjacent \isi{stop}). Second, when asked to syllabify a word, native speakers do not place a \isi{syllable} boundary between a \isi{nasal} and a following \isi{voiced} \isi{stop}.\footnote{For example, umbenam ‘morning’ is broken into [u.ᵐbe.nam], and not into \textsuperscript{†}[um.be.nam]. Note that, while CC \isi{onset}s are possible in Ulwa (\sectref{sec:2.3}), there are no known \isi{nasal}-plus-(heterorganic) \isi{stop} \isi{onset}s; therefore, the interpretation \textsuperscript{†}/u.mbe.nam/ is highly unlikely. It may also be noted that the syllabification of words with \isi{prenasalized} \isi{stop}s can be affected in language attrition, as I have noticed that children, when asked to syllabify Ulwa words, follow the \isi{phonotactics} of \ili{Tok Pisin}, producing forms such as [um.be.nam] for umbenam ‘morning’.} Third, in \isi{loanword}s from languages that have a simple voiced-\isi{stop} series, these phonemes are very frequently realized in Ulwa as \isi{prenasalized} \isi{voiced} \isi{stop}s.\footnote{For example, the \ili{Tok Pisin} word nogat ‘no’ is often pronounced as [no.ᵑɡat].} Finally, \isi{nasal} segments can precede \isi{voiceless} \isi{stop}s.

Phonetics and phonology\label{sec:2,Metathesis\label{sec:2.6,,,,"Unlike these somewhat unusual changes, however, there is one word for which \isi{metathesis} is rather common. The \isi{postposition} ul ‘with’ is often realized as [lu]. Perhaps counterintuitively, this \isi{allomorphy} generally occurs when the \isi{postposition} immediately follows a \isi{consonant} (as opposed to a \isi{vowel}), resulting in a sequence of two \isi{consonant}s (across a \isi{syllable} boundary). Some examples of metathesized ul ‘with’ are given in \REF{ex:phon:94}.",ex:phon:94,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Phonetics and phonology\label{sec:2,Metathesis\label{sec:2.6,,,,"The metathesized version also sometimes occurs even when following a \isi{vowel}s provided the object of the \isi{postposition} is not a \isi{clitic} (\isi{object marker}s ma= ‘3\textsc{sg.obj}’ and ndï= ‘3\textsc{pl}’, for example, never license the metathesized form, but are rather always followed by [ul]).

Phonetics and phonology\label{sec:2,Phonetics and phonology of connected speech\label{sec:2.7,,,,"This chapter may be concluded with an impressionistic note on the sounds of \isi{connected speech} in Ulwa. Similar to the \isi{synalepha} found in languages like \ili{Spanish}, there is a tendency in Ulwa for words to blend together, such that it is often impossible (on phonetic grounds) to separate one word from the next. Specifically, sound changes such as \isi{elision} and \isi{coalescence} of \isi{vowel}s at word boundaries are common in rapid speech. Sometimes two \isi{vowel}s \isi{coalesce} when an \isi{epenthetic} \isi{glide} might otherwise be expected. For example, the sequence /i#a/ may be realized as [e] instead of [iya], as in \REF{ex:phon:97}.",ex:phon:97,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

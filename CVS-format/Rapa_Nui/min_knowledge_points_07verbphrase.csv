It is no coincidence that in the first case mai is used, indicating orientation towards the subject as deictic centre, while in the second case atu is used, pointing away from the subject. In other texts as well, piko mai is commonly used when people hide from others, while piko atu is used of people lying in ambush, spying on someone else (cf. \citealt[12]{Fuller1980}). While there is no movement involved, the directionals\is{Directional} indicate \textsc{orientation} with respect to the deictic centre.\footnote{\label{fn:357}\citet[1751]{Hooper2004} discusses a similar function of directionals\is{Directional} in \ili{Tokelauan}. She points out (with reference to \citealt{Jackendoff1983}) that a path (i.e. a directional\is{Directional} movement) may play various roles: an object may traverse a path, but it may also be oriented along a path, facing an entity (in this case, the deictic centre).}",ex:7.143,\gll ...tū pū era o Huri \ꞌa Vai e \textbf{piko} \textbf{mai} era \ꞌi roto. | \gls ~~~DEM hole DIST of Huri a Vai IPFV hide hither DIST at inside | \glt ‘...the hole where Huri a Vai was hiding.’,ex:7.144,\gll He e\ꞌa he oho mai a tū ara era \ꞌi ira a Kāiŋa e \textbf{piko} \textbf{atu} era. | \gls NTR go_out NTR go hither by DEM way DIST at ANA PROP Kainga IPFV hide away DIST | \glt ‘(Vaha) came out by that road where Kainga was hiding.’,ex:7.143,\gll ...tū pū era o Huri \ꞌa Vai e \textbf{piko} \textbf{mai} era \ꞌi roto. | \gls ~~~DEM hole DIST of Huri a Vai IPFV hide hither DIST at inside | \glt ‘...the hole where Huri a Vai was hiding.’,ex:7.144,\gll He e\ꞌa he oho mai a tū ara era \ꞌi ira a Kāiŋa e \textbf{piko} \textbf{atu} era. | \gls NTR go_out NTR go hither by DEM way DIST at ANA PROP Kainga IPFV hide away DIST | \glt ‘(Vaha) came out by that road where Kainga was hiding.’,,,,,,,,,,,,

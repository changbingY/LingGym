,Sociolinguistic situation\label{sec:1.4,Orthography\label{sec:1.4.4,,,"Another issue concerns word boundaries: should the causative marker haka be connected to the root (hakaoho ‘to cause to go’) or be treated as a separate word (haka~oho)? The same question applies to nominalisers like iŋa: vānaŋaiŋa or vānaŋa iŋa ‘speaking’?

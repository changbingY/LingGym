,Introduction\label{sec:11.1,,,,"In Rapa Nui, different strategies are used to combine clauses, depending on the type of clause. Some constructions have a conjunction, others have a preverbal subordinating \is{Conjunction}marker, others yet are unmarked.\footnote{\label{fn:503}The latter can be recognised as subordinate clauses by the use of the negator \textit{ta{\ꞌ}e} (see \REF{ex:11.210} on p.~\pageref{ex:11.210}), and by the use of aspectual marker (only i, e or ka; the verb is always followed by a postverbal demonstrative).} Conjunctions only occur in certain types of adverbial clauses and will be discussed in the appropriate subsections of \sectref{sec:11.6}. Preverbal markers cut through the distinction between types of subordinate clauses, therefore they are discussed separately in \sectref{sec:11.5}.",ex:11.210,"\gll \obI \textbf{ta\ꞌe} kore era tu\ꞌu tokerau era\,\cb he mana\ꞌu mo haka tītika i te vaka ki Tahiti. | \gls {\db}PFV CONNEG lack DIST POSS.2SG.O wind DIST NTR think for CAUS straight ACC ART boat to Tahiti | \glt ‘When the wind did not die down, they decided to steer the boat to Tahiti.’",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,Relative clauses\label{sec:11.4,Possessive-relative constructions\label{sec:11.4.4,,,"Possessive-relative constructions occur in other Polynesian languages as well. There has been some discussion on the question whether the possessor\is{Possession} is raised from the subject\is{Subject!raising} position of the relative clause\is{Clause!relative} (e.g. \citealt[367]{Harlow2000}; \citealt[185]{Harlow2007Maori}), or whether it is a genuine noun phrase possessor\is{Possession} which happens to be coreferential to the relative clause subject \citep[116]{Clark1976}. In Rapa Nui the second option is more plausible. First, the possessor\is{Possession} can be in the same positions as in any other noun phrase, which suggests that it is no different from other possessors in the noun phrase. Second, as the examples above show, the form of the possessive construction varies between \is{Possession!o/a distinction}a- and o-possession: a{}-possession in \REF{ex:11.123}, \REF{ex:11.125} and \REF{ex:11.127}, o{}-possession in \REF{ex:11.124} and \REF{ex:11.126}. As a- and o-possession express different semantic relationships between possessor\is{Possession} and possessee (\sectref{sec:6.3.2}), this suggests that there is a direct relation between the possessor\is{Possession} and the head noun, even though the primary function of the possessor\is{Possession} seems to be the expression of the relative clause\is{Clause!relative} subject.\footnote{\label{fn:517}\citet{HerdMacdonald2011} make a similar observation for other Polynesian languages. They propose a structure where there is a relation between the possessor\is{Possession} and the relative construction as a whole. This involves a control relation (not raising) between possessor\is{Possession} and relative clause\is{Clause!relative} subject.} And indeed, in most of these cases the choice between \textit{{\ꞌ}a} and o is governed by the same principles guiding this choice in possessive constructions in general. In \REF{ex:11.127}, where the relation between possessor\is{Possession} and head noun is one between husband and wife, \textit{{\ꞌ}a} is used (\sectref{sec:6.3.3.1.1}). In \REF{ex:11.125}, the use of \textit{{\ꞌ}a} is possibly motivated by the active relationship of the possessee to the head noun ‘work’ (\sectref{sec:6.3.3.2} item 2). In \REF{ex:11.126}, o is used with a temporal noun, again conforming to a general pattern (\sectref{sec:6.3.3.3} item 11). In fact, given the wide range of relationships expressed by possessive constructions in Rapa Nui, all possessive-relatives seem to exhibit some kind of possessive relationship also attested in simple possessive constructions.",ex:11.123,"\gll ...mo haka oho ki \textbf{tā}\textbf{\ꞌ}\textbf{ana} kona era \obi pohe\,\cb. | \gls ~~~for CAUS go to POSS.3SG.A place DIST {\db}PFV desire | \glt ‘...to make (the horse) go to the place he wanted (it to go).’",ex:11.125,"\gll Te aŋa ra\ꞌe \textbf{\ꞌā\ꞌana} \obi aŋa\,\cb he hāpa\ꞌo māmoe. | \gls ART work first POSS.3SG.A {\db}PFV do PRED care_for sheep | \glt ‘The first work he did, was looking after sheep.’",ex:11.127,"\gll Te kenu \textbf{\ꞌa} \textbf{Hetu\ꞌu} \obi rova\ꞌa ai\,\cb, kenu rivariva. | \gls ART spouse of.A Hetu’u {\db}PFV obtain PVP husband good:RED | \glt ‘The husband which Hetu’u obtained, was a good husband.’",ex:11.124,"\gll ¿Pē hē te vai i kōnā ai \ꞌi \textbf{tō\ꞌoku} hora \obrere mai nei\,\cb? | \gls ~like CQ ART water PFV splash PVP in POSS.1SG.O time {\db}jump hither PROX | \glt ‘How did the water splash at the time when I jumped?’",ex:11.126,"\gll \ꞌI tū hora era \textbf{o} \textbf{Kekoa} \obe rere mai era\,\cb... | \gls at DEM time DIST of Kekoa {\db}IPFV jump hither DIST | \glt ‘At the moment when Kekoa jumped...’",ex:11.127,"\gll Te kenu \textbf{\ꞌa} \textbf{Hetu\ꞌu} \obi rova\ꞌa ai\,\cb, kenu rivariva. | \gls ART spouse of.A Hetu’u {\db}PFV obtain PVP husband good:RED | \glt ‘The husband which Hetu’u obtained, was a good husband.’",ex:11.125,"\gll Te aŋa ra\ꞌe \textbf{\ꞌā\ꞌana} \obi aŋa\,\cb he hāpa\ꞌo māmoe. | \gls ART work first POSS.3SG.A {\db}PFV do PRED care_for sheep | \glt ‘The first work he did, was looking after sheep.’",ex:11.126,"\gll \ꞌI tū hora era \textbf{o} \textbf{Kekoa} \obe rere mai era\,\cb... | \gls at DEM time DIST of Kekoa {\db}IPFV jump hither DIST | \glt ‘At the moment when Kekoa jumped...’",,,,

A somewhat more plausible analysis would be to consider the verb as incorporated into the noun; however, the directional\is{Directional} mai in \REF{ex:11.247} shows that the verb is the head of a true verb phrase. It is best to analyse these constructions simply as a combination of a noun phrase and a bare purpose clause, rather than assuming that the noun phrase + verb are a single constituent. An additional reason to do so is that this construction is not an isolated phenomenon, but an instance (admittedly, the most common instance) of a group of constructions in which a locative noun phrase and a purpose clause occur together. Related constructions include:",ex:11.247,\gll He iri ararua \textbf{ki} \textbf{te} \textbf{rāua} \textbf{hoi} \textbf{\ꞌa\ꞌaru} \textbf{mai}. | \gls NTR ascend the_two to ART 3PL horse grab hither | \glt ‘Both of them went to grab their horse.’,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

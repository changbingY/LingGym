,Introduction; constituent order\label{sec:8.1,,,,"As pointed out above, most of this chapter will be concerned with the order of constituents and the marking of S, A and O arguments.\footnote{\label{fn:379}See Footnote \ref{fn:109} on p.~\pageref{fn:109} on the terms S, A and O. In this grammar, any clause in which an O argument is either expressed or implied, is counted as transitive\is{Verb!transitive} (regardless other arguments); a clause without an expressed or implied O is considered intransitive (cf. (\ref{ex:3.84}–\ref{ex:3.86}) on p.~\pageref{ex:3.84})\is{Verb!intransitive}. Verbs with a nominalised verb\is{Verb!nominalised} as complement are counted as transitive\is{Verb!transitive}; verbs with a subordinate clause as complement are counted as intransitive\is{Verb!intransitive}.} A preliminary question concerns the expression of these arguments as such. The verb phrase is the only obligatory element in the verbal clause: any argument can be omitted if its identity is understood from the context. In discourse, both S/A and O are usually left implicit when they are identical to a constituent in the previous clause. An example in which both A and O are implied, is the following:",ex:3.84,\gll Kai haŋa a Puakiva mo kai i tū kai era. | \gls NEG.PFV want PROP Puakiva for eat ACC DEM food DIST | \glt ‘Puakiva did not want to eat that food.’,ex:3.86,\gll ¿Ko kai \ꞌā koe? | \gls ~PRF eat CONT 2SG | \glt ‘Have you eaten?’,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This happens especially in passives (see \REF{ex:8.54} in \sectref{sec:8.5.1} below) and pseudopassives (\sectref{sec:8.5.2}, ex. \REF{ex:8.61}).

Secondly, the same sentence does in fact occur in a text by Englert (a translated Bible story), but there e is absent: e~ora rō ia (Egt-03.041).

Verbs,,,,,"Verbs are the biggest word class in Vamale after nouns. They make up over a third of the recorded lexicon (1314/3627), with nouns numbering 1844 (counting proper nouns and common deverbal nominalizations). In Vamale, apart from predication, verbs may modify nouns (covered in \sectref{sec:ModNoun}) and verbs alike (\sectref{ssec:CompV}, \sectref{sec:SVC}, and \sectref{ssec:MannerV}), though adverbs exist as well (\sectref{sec:Adv}). Intransitive verbs can form clauses on their own. Verbs can be divided into three main classes, according to their subject-indexing morphology. Active verbs, which bear subject-indexing on their left (see \sectref{sec:ActV}), mark transitive subjects like agent-like intransitive subjects, compare examples (\ref{ex:itr}) and (\ref{ex:an}) (\Cref{fig:alignment}). Stative verbs, described in \sectref{sec:StatV}, take suffixes for subject-indexing (\ref{ex:stat}) and use morphemes distinct from undergoer-indexing suffixes, shown in \Cref{tab:markers2}. Verbs usually index the subject, except in imperative constructions, in serial verb constructions if they are not the first verb, and, for stative verbs, if the subject is inanimate. The argument markers can be omitted for pragmatic reasons, most prominently in lists of things happening, or when it is otherwise clear to whom something happens, as in (\ref{ex:same-subject}).",ex:itr,\gll le=soom | \gls 3PL=swim | \glt They swim.,ex:an,\gll le=caihna li=apuli | \gls 3PL=know DEF.PL=person | \glt They know the people.,ex:stat,\gll sinu-le | \gls suffer-3PL | \glt They suffer.,ex:same-subject,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,

One subset of impersonal verbs, the affirmative existential vwa and the negative existential cika, can only take a noun phrase as an argument, but these are not the subject, as evidenced by their inability to take ka \qu{\gl{sbj}}. This excludes pronouns. Since Vamale does not have a word for \qu{to have}, having or not having something is expressed with possessive constructions, as in (\ref{ex:vwa_have}): e.g. \qu{there is for me}, calqued into local French: Il y a une femme pour toi? \qu{Is there a wife for you?} meaning \qu{Do you have a wife?} Cika \qu{\gl{neg}.\gl{exist}} only takes inanimate and non-specific animate arguments, while cia- is open to arguments of any animacy, and generic inanimates.

Having a variety of verbs for striking with different tools is an old feature of Oceanic. \Cref{tab:POcV} (page~\pageref{tab:POcV}) gives a short selection of Proto-Oceanic verbs.\footnote{The form *sasa is given by \parencite{grace_proto-oceanic_1969}.} The posture prefixes cu- \qu{do standing}, ta- \qu{do sitting}, see (\ref{ex:ta-meebam}), and mi- \qu{do lying down}, are unique to Northern languages \parencite[356]{ozanne-rivierre_verbal_2004}. Note that Ozanne-Rivierre and Rivierre call verbs prefixed by the morphemes described here ``compound verbs"", whereas I use the term exclusively for verbs where all components are also attested as single head verbs.",ex:ta-meebam,"\gll bo tha xa-vaaya-n-eo i= m=e=ta-meebam aa ca-n sohmun | \gls IRR ASS AGT.NMLZ-work-POSS-1SG.POSS DEF.SG SUBR=1SG=sit-sleep uuh in-NSPEC study | \glt That would be my habit, the\ldots if I slept sitting in school.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Verbs,Prefixes,the- ,,,"The productive, non-manner prefix t(h)e- has two meanings, depending on the aktionsart of the verb. With punctual verbs, it means \qu{do quickly, a bit}. With durative ones, it means \qu{do continually since earlier}, often with reference to another event, e.g. the-xaleke \qu{look at constantly}, and (\ref{ex:constant_the}). This is likely due to its putative origin thêên \qu{run, fly}.

Verbs,Prefixes,the- ,,,"The- can be used with imperative verbs, where it asks for immediate action: \qu{do this now, do this quickly}.

In some scenarios, the two have similar meanings.% shortens vowel if combined with e.g. da, the, etc. possibly not phonemically long vowel.",ex:the_imp,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Verbs,Prefixes,the- ,,,"The attenuative meaning of xhaa- is found with imperative the- when the latter is used to suggest that the action asked for will be quick. The difference, however, is that the- suggests a quickly done task, whereas xhaa- means you do something for a short while, without necessarily finishing what you started. The- and xha(a)- can be combined (\ref{ex:xhaa}). When combined, their meaning depends on the verb's aktionsart: \qu{quickly do now (\gl{punc})}, \qu{do a non-committally big or small bit of it (\gl{dur})}.",ex:xhaa,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Verbs,Prefixes,"da \qu{do first, ra- \qu{do afterwards",,,"Two morphemes can be used to sort an action with respect to other actions: da(a) \qu{do first} (\ref{ex:da_first}), and ra- \qu{do afterwards} (\ref{ex:ra}). Note that the latter is the only phonemic example of /ɾ/, and was only encountered in elicitation sessions.

Verbs,Prefixes,Pluractional e-,,,"A pluractional prefix e- occurs in various constructions where several entities perform the same action at the same time, but not to each other, e.g. (\ref{ex:ehan_caile}) and (\ref{ex:etipwa}). The prefix is reconstructed to be a reflex of POc *paRi-, which otherwise has reflexive, reciprocal, and middle functions. If e- were left out, the pluractional meaning would be lost, and the participants would be engaged in their activities in a more individual manner: compare examples (\ref{ex:ehan_cain}) and (\ref{ex:ehan_caile}) to le han cai-n \qu{They follow him} and le han cai-le \qu{They follow them}. Note that in constructions such as (\ref{ex:ehan_caile}), the meaning is somewhat in between reciprocal (they follow each other), further described in \sectref{sec:refl}, and pluractional (they each follow a different person). This is called ``chaining"" by Bril, and widely attested throughout the archipelago \parencite[32, 47]{bril_semantic_2005b}.",ex:ehan_caile,Not found,ex:etipwa,Not found,ex:ehan_cain,Not found,ex:ehan_caile,Not found,ex:ehan_caile,Not found,,,,,,,,,,

Verbs,Complex verbs,Reduplication,,,"True reduplication in Vamale is rare. Cases abound where a verb is repeated, to express the length, urgency, intensity etc. of a notion: most frequent is the context of a serial verb construction (described in \sectref{sec:SVC}), but verbs are also repeated in a poetic context such as in (\ref{ex:xho}), or in a playful one (\ref{ex:javelo}). These verbs usually have their own prosodic environment and the whole construction is lexically transparent.\largerpage[-1]",ex:xho,"\gll tabo tabo li=xho thamo thêên thêên li=xho xayu | \gls sit sit DEF.PL=cicada female fly fly DEF.PL=cicada male | \glt Sit sit oh female cicadas [full of eggs], fly fly (away) oh male cicadas.",ex:javelo,\gll jaaaavelo-velo-velo-velo | \gls ricochet | \glt ricochet-chet-chet-chet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Verbs,Complex verbs,Compound verbs,,,"An important group of compound verbs are composed of the vague verb vwa \qu{do}, and a specifying verb, e.g. vwa-suu \qu{do break} \qu{pay someone}, vwa tau \qu{do impact} \qu{fish},\footnote{This is almost certainly a taboo avoidance strategy. Hunters never use vap \qu{to hunt} if they go out, instead they say balan thaap \qu{length nyaouli [a savannah tree species]} when describing their plans, to avoid bad luck. Vwa tau would have replaced the marked word. Word avoidance taboos are commonplace in this region of the world. Perhaps the word for \qu{wound}, ape aman \qu{trace\slash track of something} is kept vague on purpose.\is{Word avoidance taboo}} or vwa-thiho \qu{do-stumble} \qu{do by accident}. Another group, small but very often used, are the lexicalized serial verb constructions (SVCs) with fe \qu{take} and motion verbs, e.g. (\ref{ex:feame}). Other verb compounds also seem to be lexicalized SVCs, e.g. saahma-cuut \qu{rise-be.standing} \qu{to stand up}, and ha-de-ha-me \qu{go-\gl{dir.cf}-go-\gl{dir.cp}} \qu{move to and fro}.",ex:feame,\gll fe-(h)a(n)-me | \gls take-go-DIR.CP | \glt bring,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Verbs,Nominal derivation,,,,"Whether a given verb is nominalized via prefixation or stripping is lexically determined, since nominalizing via stripping is not accepted for some verbs (e.g. *i thapoke \qu{the beginning}, or *i hmanan \qu{his/her hunger}). Another example is hun-vwa kan \qu{manner-do it; the style of doing it, the act of doing it} which cannot be *vwa kan or even *vwa.

Verbs,Nominal derivation,,,,"Stripped nominalizations, contrary to the other de-verbal constructions detailed below, do not express a subject through possessive means, but keep the same strategy as normal verb phrases, i.e. using a noun phrase flagged with ka \qu{sbj}: ka li=apuli \qu{\gl{sbj} \gl{def}.\gl{pl}=person} in (\ref{ex:i_jili}).

Verbs,Nominal derivation,xa-,,,"Xa- \qu{\gl{agt}.\gl{nmlz}}, an agentive nominalizer, is probably derived from xayu \qu{male}. Since in Vamale, modifiers usually follow the modified, and possessors the possessum, xa- may be an old phrase head, now incorporated into the former modifying phrase. The nominalizer may have developed from a noun phrase with an optionally marked relative clause (\ref{ex:xavwatau}), which was gradually reduced to xay(u) vwa-tau, and finally to xa-vwa-tau \qu{fisherman}.",ex:xavwatau,\gll xayu (a=a=) vwa-tau | \gls male (REL=3SG) make-impact | \glt the man who fishes (the relativizer a is often omitted),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Verbs,Nominal derivation,hun-,,,"As with other derivations, whether hun- means \qu{style} or \qu{tradition}, or something more idiosyncratic, can depend on the verb. Compare examples (\ref{ex:hun}--\ref{ex:hunvi1}): moo \qu{to stay} keeps the same meaning for inanimate and animate subjects (\ref{ex:hun1}, \ref{ex:hunmoo}). However, the derivation of vii \qu{to say} takes on an idiosyncratic meaning with inanimate subjects, \qu{its meaning} (\ref{ex:hunvi2}) and it keeps a transparent one with an animate subject: \qu{his/her way of saying} (\ref{ex:hunvi1}).",ex:hun,\gll hun-moo ka-n | \gls NMLZ-be LINK-NSPEC | \glt its nature,ex:hunvi1,\gll hun-vii-a | \gls NMLZ-say-3SG | \glt his/her way of saying it,ex:hun1,\gll hun-moo ka-n | \gls NMLZ-be LINK-NSPEC | \glt its nature,ex:hunmoo,\gll hun-moo-a | \gls NMLZ-stay-3SG | \glt her/his character,ex:hunvi2,\gll hun-vii ka-n | \gls NMLZ-say LINK-NSPEC | \glt (its) meaning,ex:hunvi1,\gll hun-vii-a | \gls NMLZ-say-3SG | \glt his/her way of saying it,,,,,,,,
Verbs,Nominal derivation,hun-,,,"Compared to the other nominalizing prefixes, hun- is the most neutral one, which casts doubt on the \qu{manner} meaning postulated above. See example (\ref{ex:hunpala}), where a nominalization is used because goon \qu{enough} only bears this meaning if it does not subordinate pala \qu{talk}. Otherwise, goon, ma... would mean \qu{permitted, to...}, as in (\ref{ex:goon_hunpala}).

Verbs,Nominal derivation,Nominalized verb phrases,,,"As well as deriving verbs, Vamale can derive whole verb phrases, the resulting construction being internally a verb phrase with identifiable referents, and externally a noun phrase, that can function as an argument. Consider the Bwatoo example in example (\ref{ex:Bwatoo_derivVP}). Speakers confirmed the acceptability of its Vamale equivalent in (\ref{ex:Vam_derivVP}). In both cases, a ditransitive verb phrase is derived to a noun by dropping the subject marker and adding an article i= (or ani, in Bwatoo). This is one way to derive a verb phrase, though the nominalizing prefix hun- is also commonly used.",ex:Bwatoo_derivVP,Not found,ex:Vam_derivVP,"\gll (ca)ma koin i=\textbf{vwatipwe} \textbf{nya-sii-le} i=bween-aman... | \gls COND end DEF.SG=drop put-hand-3PL DEF=exchange-thing | \glt When giving the gift to them is done,\ldots",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Verbs,Nominal derivation,Nominalization with ka-n,,,"Deverbal nominalizations may carry the linker ka-, with -n \qu{\gl{nspec}, \gl{ana}} in generic and anaphoric contexts.

The distribution of ka reflects the animacy of the participants: animate S or O cannot take ka if expressed covertly (i.e. through affixes), but may take it optionally if overtly present (i.e. as noun phrases), as in (\ref{ex:ka overt1}).

In this tree, ka is shown to be \qu{moved} after the argument before the possessor, like in (\ref{ex:moving ka}), but it hosts a resumptive morpheme then: -n \qu{\gl{ana}}. This anaphoric use of -n also occurs on dependent verbs (\sectref{ssec:active-n}) and prepositions (\sectref{ssec:WCPrepoNouns}). This means that ka is not a suffix, since it tolerates a whole noun phrase in between it and the verb root. It also means that ka, although likely related to the \gl{S\textsubscript{P}}/\gl{S\textsubscript{A}}-marker, is distinct from the latter, since the \gl{S\textsubscript{P}}/\gl{S\textsubscript{A}}-marker cannot be used resumptively.

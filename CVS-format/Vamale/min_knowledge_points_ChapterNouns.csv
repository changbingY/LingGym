Nouns,,,,,"Vamale nouns are defined in this grammar as single words which can bear articles (see \sectref{sec:WCArticles}). Few other factors distinguish nouns from verbs, as nouns can be predicates with the same subject index markers as active verbs, see (\ref{ex:e-caacaa}). Only nouns, however, can be arguments of verbs, can be counted, can be possessed (though possessive morphology shows overlaps with some verbal morphology (see \sectref{sec:StatV} and \sectref{ssec:PossV}), and not all nouns can be possessed, e.g. jati \qu{sea}). Although nouns do take some TAM marking, not all TAM marking is attested for nouns (e.g. bwa balan \qu{only just (begun)}, kon \qu{\gl{prog}}). Nouns are not inflected for number; this is covered by articles (for specific nouns; generic ones do not have articles).",ex:e-caacaa,\gll e=juura caacaa | \gls 1SG=almost father | \glt I am almost a father (soon).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nouns,Animacy,,,,Animate participants further trigger person marking on stative verbs (\ref{ex:animNstV}) and must be indexed with suffixes on transitive verbs (\ref{ex:animNOBJ}). Both contexts omit any indexing if the relevant noun phrase occurs within the verb phrase (\ref{ex:animNinVP}).,ex:animNstV,"\gll ka abe niehni a= \textbf{thien-abe} | \gls CNJ 1PL.EXCL DEM.PL REL= three-1PL.EXCL | \glt And we are those [masters of the rock], who are three (and we are these three masters of the rock).",ex:animNOBJ,\gll na cahni tha xhwan see-a a= thathe-\textbf{a} | \gls DEM here ASS a.bit one-3SG REL= kill-3SG.OBJ | \glt Here there was only one that was killed.,ex:animNinVP,\gll hmwet i=apuli | \gls tired DEF.SG=person | \glt The person is tired.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nouns,Possession,,,,"Possessed nouns make a distinction in alienability, i.e. whether they can occur without marking a possessor. This is a widespread Oceanic phenomenon \parencite[511]{ross_morphosyntactic_2004}. Alienable and inalienable nouns follow certain semantic tendencies outlined in Table \ref{tab:semantic_poss}, though there are numerous exceptions. Non-possessible nouns include proper names and unique concepts such as the sea or the sun, although poetic contexts may feature counterevidence. Another exception is la \qu{place}, which can neither be generic (as would be indicated by -n on preceding verbs and prepositions), nor take an article, but syntactically behaves like a noun otherwise (i.e. it follows prepositions) (\ref{ex:la}).",ex:la,\gll suu cahni ca la | \gls break here in place | \glt Break it here at this spot!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nouns,Possession,Inalienable,,,"Some inalienable nouns, in compounds where they are not the head, lose their possessive morphology when they do not have a specific referent, e.g. mwa-n nyama \qu{glasses (in general, nobody's glasses)}. If possessed, however, it is the second part of the compound that is possessed, i.e. mwa-n nyamaa-ng \qu{my glasses}. See also vwa suki(-n) \qu{pay (for something)}, which, nominalized, becomes xavwasuki \qu{money-spender}, glossed in (\ref{ex:xavwasuki}). This is not attested for e-vwadi ya-n \qu{thumb (lit. \gl{nmlz}.\gl{ins}-peel.with.fingers starchy.food-\gl{poss})}, possibly because a thumb is itself an inalienable concept, whereas glasses are alienable.",ex:xavwasuki,\gll xa=vwa-suki | \gls NMLZ.AGT=do-price | \glt a money-spender,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nouns,Classifiers,,,,"Classifiers are a well-established and rich class in both Nêlêmwa \parencite{bril_nelemwa_2002} and Iaai, but not thought to be widespread in Mainland New Caledonian. In Vamale, there is a semantically defined group of nouns that easily and often forms quasi-possessive phrases with other nouns. Most of these nouns are inalienably possessed. They form the head of their phrase; the other noun cannot bear an article (\ref{ex:foodCL2}), and, in the cases discussed here, cannot occur without the head (in the semantic contexts which warrant these constructions). In any case, the nouns discussed here can occur without the modifying noun. Following \textcite{aikhenvald_classifiers_2000}, this study will call these nouns classifiers. Words like saleka-n \qu{possession}, coola-n \qu{task, part of collective work}, sana- \qu{content}, san-fe (content-take) \qu{hunting bounty}, mwa-n \qu{container}, as well as the items in \Cref{tab:bit}, work the same way, with the exception that they can be omitted. The latter group thus seems to be frequent compound heads, described as generic-specific constructions \parencite[86]{aikhenvald_classifiers_2000}, rather than classifiers. They are discussed in detail in \sectref{sec:CompN}.",ex:foodCL2,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nouns,Classifiers,Relational classifier ka,,,"Vamale has a morpheme ka- that takes inalienable possessive morphology, is used to mark usually unpossessed nouns as possessed (\ref{ex:kan2}), and contains semantic information about the relationship between possessor and possessum. The morpheme is obligatory in certain scenarios but optional in others. I call ka- a relational classifier:\footnote{Following \textcite[136]{aikhenvald_classifiers_2000} and especially \textcite[399]{lichtenberk_oceanic_2009}.} ka does not specify the nature of either noun phrase in the possessive phrase. However, the semantics of the classifier is somewhat vague and could be described as ``relating to the possessor"", a term borrowed from the gloss for the relational classifier 'e in Boumaa Fijian \parencite[135]{dixon_grammar_1988}. While \textcite{lichtenberk_oceanic_2009} accepts such aberrant behavior for a classifier on the grounds that languages have unique categories, he mostly uses the term ``possessive marker"".",ex:kan2,\gll difaadi ka-n | \gls echo REL.CLF-NSPEC | \glt its echo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nouns,Classifiers,Relational classifier ka,,,"ka- is obligatory for daahma \qu{chief} (\ref{ex:kaposs1}), phwêêdi \qu{youngest child/sibling}, bifidu \qu{twin} and a few other nouns possessed through interpersonal relationships. The linker is in some cases part of a lexicalized possessive noun phrase (\ref{ex:kaposs2}, \ref{ex:kan1}). It is also found on:",ex:kaposs1,\gll daahma k-ong | \gls chief REL.CLF-1SG.POSS | \glt my chief,ex:kaposs2,\gll daahma ka-n mani | \gls chief REL.CLF-NSPEC bird | \glt chief of birds [erythrura psittacea],ex:kan1,\gll i ka-n xavwaxhan | \gls louse REL.CLF-NSPEC dog | \glt flea,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nouns,Classifiers,Relational classifier ka,,,"There are a number of irregular forms which show etymological final consonants that have since merged to the plosives -t, -p, -k, -c (see \sectref{sec:consphonemes}). For example, fedat \qu{blood}, POc *daaR, retains the historical liquid in the possessed form feda-l-am \qu{your blood}. The possessive morphology of these irregular forms follows the same laws (compare (\ref{ex:kaposs2}) to (\ref{ex:fedat})) and is a predictable allomorph of ka-. In fact ka- only follows vowel-final possessums, whereas consonant-final words take -an, e.g. japit/japit-an \qu{travel provisions; salary}. Prosodically, constructions with ka- have at least two p-words: the possessed NP, and ka, which can hence be analyzed as an anticlitic: not an own grammatical word (g-word), but an own phonological word (p-word) \parencite{zuniga_anti_2014}. However, the consonant-final possessed NPs only have one main stress, and thus count as a single p-word. Fedalan, for example, is split [ˈfɛⁿ.da.lan], with the stress on the first syllable (see vamale-181020-01-batis-bonjour-tontons-1, 01:27). We thus have a situation where the same morpheme has a different phonological status depending on its host's final form. It seems likely that the indirect possessive constructions with the linker ka- being an own g-word was the original situation, and that the linker was phonologically incorporated into the host for most contexts: juujuu ka-m (truth \gl{poss}-2\gl{sg}.\gl{poss}) \qu{you're right (not \qu{your truth})}, but muliv-ong (life 1\gl{sg}.\gl{poss}) \qu{I am alive}. Related to this, at least diachronically, are the possessive morphemes discussed in \sectref{kan}, though the latter are optional. % (vs mulip eong {my life})",ex:kaposs2,\gll daahma ka-n mani | \gls chief REL.CLF-NSPEC bird | \glt chief of birds [erythrura psittacea],ex:fedat,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nouns,Classifiers,Relational classifier ka,,,"An ambiguous case is that of mae \qu{fire, light}. Normally non-possessed, two possessive constructions are employed to talk about mae \qu{lighter}, probably calqued from a local French term feu \qu{fire; lighter} (\ref{ex:maekong}). One is that of alienable nouns (e.g. -n-eong), and the other uses ka. Since there is a choice in the morphology to be used, mae is reminiscent of another relational morpheme: the optional, focussed possession marker ka, discussed in the following section.",ex:maekong,\gll mae k-ong | \gls fire CLF.POSS-1SG | \glt my lighter (optional: my lighter),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nouns,Classifiers,Focussed Possession marker ka,,,"ka is an optional preposition marking a possessor as focussed, and/or the possessum as especially important.\footnote{Something similar is described as ``close possession"" in Hebrew \parencite{berman_modern_1978}.} Because it does not say anything about the nature of the possessor itself, I do not call it a possessor classifier \parencite[125]{aikhenvald_classifiers_2000}. Instead, it seems more reasonable to call it a linker like the other ka forms, as ka- applies to alienable nouns and can be replaced by more conventional possessor marking \parencite[136]{aikhenvald_classifiers_2000}. Contrary to the lexically assigned obligatory linker discussed in \sectref{ssec:ka_CL}, this ka is optional, i.e. the noun can be marked as possessed by -n \qu{\gl{poss}} instead (\ref{ex:thala_xhaohmu}). Furthermore, while the obligatory classifier uses inalienable possessive suffixes, e.g. daahma ka-n/k-ong \qu{chief \gl{poss}-3\gl{sg}.\gl{poss}/\gl{poss}-1\gl{sg}.\gl{poss}}, phwêêdi k-an/k-ong \qu{youngest child}, ka \qu{\gl{foc}.\gl{poss}} takes nominal and pronominal possessors. Since the two morphemes are probably related and are identical in form and position, there is inter-speaker variation in their distribution: Jacob Oué maintains thala k-ong \qu{my knife} where Jean-Philippe Oué, about 20 years younger, uses thala ka yo (2019-08-05 JP ka:33). However, Philippe Gohoupe, born in the 1940s, uses ka with the pronoun gavwe instead of the suffix -vwe in (\ref{ex:ka gavwe}), i.e. he uses ka \qu{\gl{foc}.\gl{poss}} like Jean-Philippe Oué. %and the animate possessor of a tool or a dynamic relationship in established ones.",ex:thala_xhaohmu,\gll thala-n i=xhaohmu | \gls knife-POSS ART.SG=elder | \glt the elder's knife,ex:ka gavwe,\gll e=hole-ke nyasi-vwe ka=gavwe | \gls 1SG=thank-TR for-2PL FOC.POSS=2PL | \glt I thank you (in particular) [for what you did?].,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nouns,Compound nouns,,,,"Other ways of modifying a noun are relative clauses, and possessive constructions. While these also result in a noun phrase which acts as a single constituent (\ref{ex:cloud}), compound nouns are single words: they do not tolerate lexical insertions and often have idiosyncratic meanings (e.g. hmape-thoatit and yeen-bwan in ex. \ref{ex:cloud}). Compound nouns may be exocentric, use metaphors to describe their referent, or harbor other semantic relations not found in noun phrases with a relative clause, e.g. part-of-whole ones. However, in many cases there are no phonological, morphological, or syntactic ways to clearly differentiate compound nouns from unmarked noun - relative clause constructions.",ex:cloud,\gll a=xaleke {\ob\ob\ob}hmape-thoatit{\cb} a fiing{\cb} a kon nyasipoke{\cb} nya-pwa-n yee-n-bwan | \gls 3SG=see flesh-sky REL dark REL PROG gather LOC-on-NSPEC stick-POSS-mountain | \glt She saw dark clouds gathering on the mountain tops.,ex:cloud,\gll a=xaleke {\ob\ob\ob}hmape-thoatit{\cb} a fiing{\cb} a kon nyasipoke{\cb} nya-pwa-n yee-n-bwan | \gls 3SG=see flesh-sky REL dark REL PROG gather LOC-on-NSPEC stick-POSS-mountain | \glt She saw dark clouds gathering on the mountain tops.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One distinguishing feature of other noun compounds includes the use of words that have otherwise fallen out of use, a lack of possessive morphology, or an unusual word order. None of this was found with adjectives modifying nouns. Furthermore, noun phrases containing an adverb can be modified by a relative clause (\ref{ex:n+adv}). However, since relative clauses modify single-word nouns as well as noun phrases (to which an adverb can belong), no convincing syntactic arguments seem to posit the existence of said compounds.",ex:n+adv,\gll li=xhaohmu habu\textsuperscript{adv} a vwa wada-le | \gls DEF.PL=elder long.ago REL EXIST gun-3PL.POSS | \glt the elders of yore who had guns,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

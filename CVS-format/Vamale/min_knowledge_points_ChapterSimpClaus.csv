Simple clauses,Word order,,,,"Word order in Vamale does not change across clause types. Vamale is head-first and usually VOS, though fronted, bi-clausal constructions are common: S, VO. The verb always precedes the object, and the traditionally non-marked order expects the subject after the noun. Oblique arguments tend to follow objects (\ref{ex:obj_then_obl}), but pragmatic choices can invert the unmarked order (\ref{ex:obl_then_obj}). In general, the earlier a constituent is introduced, the more marked it is. %The subject is often fronted, but may then still occur after the verb, indicating that a fronted subject is not a constituent of the clause.\footnote{Prosodically, too, the fronted subject has an own contour, which yields two intonation units: the fronted subject, and the clause.} Fronting can be used to focus on any constituent, a resumptive morpheme remains in the matrix clause.",ex:obj_then_obl,\gll e=holeke [sikaa]\textsuperscript{obj} [nyasi i=apuli a= xhwata]\textsuperscript{obl} | \gls 1SG=thank.for cigarette BEN DEF.SG=man REL= bald | \glt I thank the bald man for the cigarette.,ex:obl_then_obj,\gll e=holeke nyasi-m li=fati a= go=vi | \gls 1SG=thank.for BEN-2SG.POSS DEF.PL=word REL= 2SG=say | \glt I thank you for the words.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Simple clauses,Word order,,,,"The basic word order VOS is generally more common with older speakers, while younger generations often front the subject. Stative verbs, especially with inanimate arguments such as in (\ref{ex:xhong}), seem to be exempt from the fronting mentioned above, regardless of the speaker demographic. With animate arguments, fronting is especially common, especially when the agent is stressed. Strategies to make the subject less salient to the listener include using the VOS order, as well as not mentioning the subject, and fronting the object, as in (\ref{ex:fronted_obj}).",ex:xhong,\gll sinu i=xho-ng | \gls ill DEF.SG=leg-1SG.POSS | \glt My leg hurts.,ex:fronted_obj,"\gll go, e=xale-ko | \gls 2SG 1SG=see-2SG | \glt You, I see you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its meaning does not carry information about the relationship of the surrounding clauses: while in many cases, the clause following go \qu{and then, furthermore} does semantically follow the previous ones (\ref{ex:go2}), go \qu{now, on the other hand} can also mark a change of subject.",ex:go,"\gll go tha le=vwa goo i=coutume a= tha le=vwa | \gls DISC ASS 3PL=do enough DEF.SG=custom REL= ASS 3PL=do | \glt Well, they kept the ceremonies that they did, moderate.",ex:go2,"\gll go ka e=ilake hapi gavwe wago | \gls DISC CNJ 1SG=ask COMP 2PL brave | \glt Well, and I ask you to be brave.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

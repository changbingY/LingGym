Typological overview % Main chapter title,Argument coding,,,,"Vamale has several strategies for argument coding. Its differences from those of Vamale's closest relatives, are likely due to contact with surrounding languages. (Pro)nominal subjects are marked differently from objects. As with all Northern New Caledonian languages, subject noun phrases of all verb classes are marked with dedicated (pro-clitic) particle, in this case ka, e.g. (\ref{ex:active}), or a when following a consonant-final word (e.g. a=soom a=ya \qu{she=swims \gl{sbj}=she}). However, ka \qu{\gl{sbj}} is optional and unusual for intransitive subjects, while it is obligatory for transitive ones. This is a tripartite alignment system as illustrated in \Cref{fig:intro_alignment1}, and found in other Voh-Koné languages as well.",ex:active,\gll e=bune i=balô ka=yo | \gls 1SG=steal DEF.SG=ball SBJ=1SG | \glt I steal the ball.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They index transitive subjects \gl{a} identically to agent-like intransitive subjects \gl{S\textsubscript{A}}, and distinguish them from objects \gl{p}, as in (\ref{ex:active}). Another group of verbs, ``stative verbs"", are always intransitive (\ref{ex:stative}), and mark the subject \gl{S\textsubscript{P}} similarly to undergoers in transitive verbs, but are distinct from them (see \Cref{tab:intro_markers} for the forms). %The distinction between \gl{S\textsubscript{P}} and \gl{p} forms is blurry depending on the speaker, and may in time disappear. The distinction is not found in western Voh-Koné where a strictly split-transitive system marks \gl{S\textsubscript{P}} like \gl{p} and like possessors as well, but instead the Vamale distinction mirrors the one found in Pije and Nemi spoken to the north of Vamale.",ex:active,\gll e=bune i=balô ka=yo | \gls 1SG=steal DEF.SG=ball SBJ=1SG | \glt I steal the ball.,ex:stative,\gll xawe-ong ka=yo | \gls young-1SG SBJ=1SG | \glt I am young.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Typological overview % Main chapter title,Nouns and noun phrases,,,,"Nouns can be classified as inalienable (obligatory possessive morphology) or, if the morphology can be omitted, as alienable (see \Cref{tab:intro_PossSuffix1} for the suffixes). This follows a semantic logic, as is typical of Oceanic languages: inalienable nouns include kinship terms, body parts, and other parts of an individual (e.g. dedoo-ng \qu{shadow-my}). Nouns can be possessed via direct (i.e. suffixal) or indirect (i.e. clitical) constructions, which usually depends on their alienability. However, a small number of nouns are alienable yet have directly possessed forms showing etymological stems: fedat \qu{blood}, fedal-ong \qu{my blood}. Nouns are either specific (using a definite or an indefinite article), or generic (without an article), as shown in (\ref{ex:intro_gen}). Number is also shown on the article instead of the noun. The only type of inflection found on nouns is adpossessive person marking (for animate possessors), and the formerly independent linker -n indicating that the noun is possessed by a usually post-poned fully nominal possessor (\ref{ex:intro_poss}).

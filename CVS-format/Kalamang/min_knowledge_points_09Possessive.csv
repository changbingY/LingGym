Possessive and associative constructions\is{possessive|(,Overview,,,,"Ordinary possessive constructions, the most common possessive construction type, are made by attaching a possessive suffix to the possessed (the head noun in the NP), as illustrated in~(\ref{exe:posssuff}).",exe:posssuff,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Possessive and associative constructions\is{possessive|(,Overview,,,,"Three other, much less common constructions are available. First, possessive pronouns can be used as modifiers of the possessed head noun in the NP to create a possessive construction. The possessive pronouns occur adnominally only rarely, and mostly following the kinship\is{kinship} terms esa `father' and ema `mother' as in~(\ref{exe:posspron}). Second, a combination of a possessive suffix on the possessed noun and a possessive pronoun following the possessed noun also creates a possessive construction, as in~(\ref{exe:possdouble}). Third, a combination of pronoun, possessed noun and possessive suffix is found, as illustrated in~(\ref{exe:pusunrasa}).",exe:posspron,Not found,exe:possdouble,Not found,exe:pusunrasa,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Possessive and associative constructions\is{possessive|(,Overview,,,,"The freestanding possessive pronouns can be used both as NP heads and as modifiers, whereas the suffixes always have to be attached to the NP head (the possessed noun).

Possessive and associative constructions\is{possessive|(,Basic possessive constructions,,,,"There are a number of conventionalised constructions that can or must be made by means of the third-person possessive suffix -un.

On the island where Kalamang is spoken, each coastal area around a bay has a name. Several landscape features are associated with this name. Thus, the area of Tat includes Tat Os `Tat Beach' and Tat Karimun `Cape Tat'.

Possessive and associative constructions\is{possessive|(,Possessive constructions with a freestanding possessive pronoun,,,,"The corpus contains ten different nouns that are followed by freestanding possessive pronouns. Six of these nouns are also found with a possessive suffix, which means they do not require a possessive pronoun construction.\footnote{These are pendapat `opinion' (Malay loan), toman `bag', hak `right' (Malay loan), kewe `house', asal `origin' (Malay loan) and guru `teacher' (Malay loan). A reason that many of these are Malay loans might be that possessive constructions in Papuan Malay are made with a periphrastic construction (possessor + `have' + possessum), which might trigger the use of a possessive pronoun instead of a suffix in Kalamang. In any case, the number of occurrences of these words is so low in comparison to those of esa `father' and ema `mother' that we will not consider them any further.} Wowa `aunt' and tata `grandfather' are not found with a possessive suffix, but are uncommon in the corpus. Esa `father' and ema `mother' are only found with a third-person possessive suffix, and only in teknonyms, as in~(\ref{exe:nyongemun}) and~(\ref{exe:diantaraun}) above (see also §\ref{sec:names}).",exe:nyongemun,Not found,exe:diantaraun,\gll \textbf{Dian} \textbf{tara-un=a} Pakpak=a bot=kin | \gls Dian grandparent-3POSS=FOC Fakfak=FOC go=VOL | \glt `Dian's grandfather wants to go to Fakfak.',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Possessive and associative constructions\is{possessive|(,Possessive constructions with a freestanding possessive pronoun,,,,"At this point, it is unclear whether other kinship\is{kinship} terms also require a possessive pronoun.\footnote{There is no restriction against a possessive suffix on a noun ending in /a/, cf. nika-an `my fishing line'.} Besides three occurrences of tata `grandfather' and one of wowa `aunt', there are no possessive constructions with other kinship terms. The only exception to this is the five inalienable\is{alienability} terms mentioned in §\ref{sec:posssuf}, which must carry a possessive suffix, as well as tumun `child', which may carry a possessive suffix, as was illustrated in~(\ref{exe:tumunan}) above. What is clear, however, is that words from the same semantic class (kinship terms) may behave differently with respect to possessive constructions. This also shows that alienability of the possessed does not play a role in the choice of a possessive construction, as is common elsewhere in East Indonesia \parencite[see e.g.][]{klamer2008}. Note that kinship terms are also treated differently from other nouns in possessive constructions in other languages, notably Italian and Scandinavian \parencite{delsing2002}.",exe:tumunan,"\gll an bo lembaga nerun tumun-\textbf{an} se bo temun | \gls 1SG go prison inside child-1SG.POSS IAM go big | \glt `I went to prison, and my child has grown big.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Possessive and associative constructions\is{possessive|(,Double possessive marking,,,,"A noun marked with a possessive suffix may be followed by a possessive pronoun. I refer to this as double (possessive) marking. It is unclear what the function of this kind of double constructions is.

In~(\ref{exe:tamanunmain}), the speaker picks up a picture and identifies who is in it. It is true that the referent is placed in \is{focus}focus (with focus marker =a on the possessive pronoun), but this could also have been achieved by placing the focus marker on the possessive suffix. There is no contrast between two people with a friend in this context.",exe:tamanunmain,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Possessive and associative constructions\is{possessive|(,Double possessive marking,,,,"It is rare for a noun marked with a possessive suffix to be followed by a possessive pronoun. The corpus has around ten examples. It should be noted that, as with the majority of the nouns marked with just a possessive pronoun, many nouns that have double marking are Malay loanwords. As speculated above, the fact that Papuan Malay uses a periphrastic possessive construction may trigger the use of the possessive pronoun in Kalamang. However, this does not explain the use of a possessive suffix on top of that. (\ref{exe:inja}) shows that the double construction also occurs with indigenous Kalamang words like in `name'.",exe:inja,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Possessive and associative constructions\is{possessive|(,Double possessive marking,,,,"A possessive suffix and a freestanding possessive pronoun may also be adjacent when the suffix and the pronoun designate different referents.

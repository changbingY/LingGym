Analysis of the Southern Yauyos Quechua lexicon,,,,,"This does not mean that the dialects employed identical terms in all the remaining 2387 cases (subtracting 75 for 36 pairs and one triplet). Far from it. All dialects employed identical terms in only 1603 instances. Included among these are all but 20 of the 522 words in the corpus borrowed from Spanish (examples in~\ref{ExA:1}.\footnote{Virtually any term of Spanish origin in current use in the area may be borrowed into \SYQ. I have included Spanish- origin words in the lexicon just in case they were either~\ref{ExA:1} of extremely high use (\phono{tuma-} ‘take’, ‘drink’ (\Sp~\spanish{tomar} ‘take’, ‘drink’)); \ref{ExA:2} had no corresponding indigenous term (in contemporary usage) (\phono{matansya} ‘massacre’ (\Sp~\spanish{matanza} ‘massacre’)); or~\ref{ExA:3} had altered substantially either in their pronunciation or denotation (\phono{firfanu} ‘orphan’ (\Sp~\spanish{huérfano} ‘orphan’); \phono{baliya-} ‘shoot’ (\Sp~\spanish{bala} ‘bullet’)).} Once terms of Spanish origin are eliminated, we are left with a corpus of 1940 items. All dialects agreed perfectly in their realizations of these items in 1081 cases~(56%) (examples in~\ref{ExA:2}). The remaining 755 items are accounted for as follows. In 154 cases a Quechua-origin term was realized identically in all dialects in which it was attested but remained unattested in one or more dialects, as in~\ref{ExA:3}. Given the current state of the language --~classified as “moribund” in the 2013 edition of { {Ethnologue}} \citet{ethnologue}\index[aut]{Ethnologue}(\index[aut]{Lewis, M. Paul})~-- nothing can be concluded from these gaps, neither that the dialects originally employed the same term, nor that it was necessarily different. In 630 cases, the dialects employed terms of the same root but with different realizations, as in~\ref{ExA:4}. Included among these are 236 cases where these differences can be attributed to differences in the phonology between Cacra-Hongos and the other four dialects: the realization of \textipa{*[r]} as \textipa{[l]}, for example (151 cases, examples in~\ref{ExA:5}) or \textipa{*/s/} as \textipa{[h]} (45~cases, examples in~\ref{ExA:6}). Also counted among these 745~cases are terms affected by metathesis and other phonological processes (vowel lowering (\textipa{/i/}), velarization~(\textipa{/q/}), depalatization~(\textipa{/sh/}), and gliding~(\textipa{/y/}), among others) (207 cases, examples in~\ref{ExA:7} and~\ref{ExA:8}). Finally, the sample counts terms affected by variation in verbal or nominal morphology (62 cases, examples in~\ref{ExA:9}). Principal among these are instances of words derived with past participles --~formed with \phono{-sha} in the north and \phono{-sa} in the south~-- and others that also differ by virtue of the fronting of \textipa{/sh/} (40 cases, examples in~\ref{ExA:10} and~\ref{ExA:11}).",ExA:1,Not found,ExA:1,Not found,ExA:2,Not found,ExA:3,Not found,ExA:2,Not found,ExA:3,Not found,ExA:4,Not found,ExA:5,Not found,ExA:6,Not found,ExA:7,Not found
Analysis of the Southern Yauyos Quechua lexicon,,,,,"A clear pattern emerges both with regard to the cases where the dialects employed terms of different roots and those in which they varied in their realizations of the same root term. In~32 of the~37 instances in which root terms differed, the dialects cleaved along north-south lines, with the northern dialects --~\CH{} and \LT\footnote{With the exception of two and a half cases: one where \LT{} sorts with the southern dialects~(‘make an offering’), one where \LT{} recorded no Quechua-origin term~(‘bitter’), and one where Cacra and Hongos split, Cacra alone recording a second term~(‘rain’).}~-- sorting together and the southern dialects --~\MV, \AH, and \SP~-- sorting together, as in~\ref{ExA:12}.",ExA:12,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Analysis of the Southern Yauyos Quechua lexicon,,,,,"In four of the five remaining instances San Pedro supplied the outstanding term. In~32 of the~37 cases, cognate terms could be identified for \ili{Junín} and \ili{Ayacucho} (Yauyos’ “\QI” (northern) and “\QII” (southern) neighbors, respectively). In 23 of the relevant 28 of these 32 cases, the northern dialects --~“\QI” \CH{} and “\QII” \LT~-- employed the term used in \ili{Junín}, while the southern dialects --~the “\QI” \AH{} and \SP{} and the “\QII” \MV~-- employed the term used in \ili{Ayacucho}, as in~\ref{ExA:13}.\footnote{In at least two of these 32 cases, the \ili{Junín} term had a cognate correlate in Jaqaru, an Aymaran language spoken in Tupe, Cacra’s closest neighbor to the north. The terms are \phono{kallwi-} ‘cultivate’ and \phono{liklachiku} ‘underarm’.}",ExA:13,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

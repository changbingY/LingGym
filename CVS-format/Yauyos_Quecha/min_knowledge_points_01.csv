Introduction\label{ch:introduction,,,,,"Yauyos is a critically endangered Quechuan language spoken in the Peruvian Andes, in the Province of Yauyos, Department of Lima. The language counts eight dialects. These are listed below in Table~\ref{tab:1:dialects}. At the time I undertook my research in the area, three of these had already become extinct. The missing dialects are those formerly spoken in the north of the province: Alis-Tomas (\AT{}), Huancaya-Vitis (\HVit{}) and Laraos (\Lar{}).\footnote{A ten-day town-to-town search undertaken in the north of the province in January 2010 failed to turn up any speakers of Yauyos Quechua. Some speakers of the Quechua of neighboring \ili{Huancayo}, however, could be found yet.} This grammar, therefore, unfortunately, covers only the five southern dialects: Apurí-Madeán-Viñac (\AMV{}), Azángaro-Chocos-Huangáscar (\ACH{}), Cacra-Hongos (\CH{}), Lincha-Tana (\LT{}) and Liscay-San Pedro (\SP{}).",tab:1:dialects,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Introduction\label{ch:introduction,Location\label{sec:locationofyauyos,,,,"The five dialects of \SYQ{} are spoken in the ten disctricts: Apurí, Madeán, and Viñac; Azángaro, Chocos, and Huangáscar; Lincha and Tana; Cacra and Hongos; and San Pedro. The first two sets are located in the valley created by the Huangáscar River and its principal tributary, the Viñac River, as can be seen on Map~\ref{fig:madeandistrict}. The second two are located in the valley created by the Cacra River and its principal tributaries, the Lincha and Paluche Rivers. The two valleys are separated by a chain of rather high and rocky hills. Running from east to west, these are the cerros Pishqullay, Tinco, Punta Tacana, Ranraorqo, Pishunco, Cochapata, Yanaorqo, and Shallalli.",fig:madeandistrict,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Introduction\label{ch:introduction,The dialects of Yauyos\label{sec:dialectsofyauyos,,,,"The Province is located on the border between the two large, contiguous zones where languages belonging to the two great branches of the Quechua language family are spoken: the “Quechua I” (Torero)\index[aut]{Torero, Alfredo} or “Quechua B” (Parker)\index[aut]{Parker, Gary J.} languages are spoken to its north; the “Quechua~II” or “Quechua~A” languages, to its south, as the map in Figure~\ref{Figcomp} shows.",Figcomp,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Introduction\label{ch:introduction,Classification\label{sec:classification\index[sub]{classification,,,,"Further, with a single exception,\footnote{In the \CH{} dialect, as in neighboring \ili{Junín}, the protomorphemes \textipa{*/r/}, \textipa{*/s/}, and \textipa{*/h/} are sometimes realized as \textipa{[l]}, \textipa{[h]}, and \textipa{[sh]}, respectively. I have no explanation for why these alternations occur in some cases but not in others. Indeed, it may be the case that where \CH{} differs from the rest of the dialects in that it employs \textipa{*/sh/}where they employ \textipa{*/h/, it is the former that preserves the original form.}} the five dialects are uniform phonologically, all employing a highly conservative system\footnote{An anonymous reviewer points out that other Quechuan languages, \ili{Corongo} among them, for example, are more conservative than Yauyos with respect to some features, including the preservation of the protoform *ñ in *ñi- ‘say’ and ña:-ña ‘right now’. \ili{Sihuas}, too, preserves elements of proto Quechua not found in Yauyos. In contrast, while Yauyos preserves a few proto-Quechua features not found in either \ili{Corongo} or \ili{Sihuas}, it also manifests others that reflect innovations likely adopted from neighboring QII languages.} that retains all those phonemes hypothesized by Parker and Cerrón-Palomino to have been included in the Proto-Quechua (see \sectref{sec:phoinvmor}). Table~\ref{Tab1}, below, summarizes this information. Please note that the table presents a somewhat idealized portrait and that the characteristics it posits as belonging exclusively to \QII{} may sometimes be found in \QI{} languages as well. Exceptions of which I am aware are signaled in notes to the table.",Tab1,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Introduction\label{ch:introduction,Classification\label{sec:classification\index[sub]{classification,,,,"\SYQ{} is not a jumble of dialects that, were it not for geographical accident, would not be classed together; it is, rather, a unique, largely uniform language. Although I myself do not believe that the current paradigm can be maintained, I have tried to present the data in a way that remains as neutral as possible with regard to the question of how the internal diversity within the Quechuan language family is best characterized, and, in particular, with regard to the question of whether or not the various Quechuan languages are helpfully construed as belonging to one or the other of two branches of a family tree \citep[See in particular][]{Adelaar08}.\index[aut]{Adelaar, Willem F. H.} I leave it to other scholars to interpret the data as they see fit. That said, as long as it is maintained, the current paradigm should be revised to more accurately reflect the relationships of \SYQ{} with/to the languages currently named on the Quechuan family tree as it is currently drawn. That tree groups nine of the eleven districts of southern Yauyos into five sets, assigning each of these sets the status of an independent language. Moreover, two of these sets are actually singletons, as Chocos is listed independent of \mbox{(Azángaro-)}Huangáscar, to which it is identical, and Apurí is listed independent of Madeán(-Viñac), to which it is identical. (Cacra-Hongos, the set that would deserve independent placement, if any did, appears nowhere at all). The fact that all these “languages” are completely mutually intelligible does not justify this. It further seems unjustified to place the Quechua of single villages on the level of that of whole nations --~Bolivia and Ecuador. I suggest, therefore, that Chocos be joined with \mbox{(Azángaro-)}Huangáscar, and Apurí with Madeán(-Viñac). The first of these new triplets, Azángaro-Chocos-Hunagáscar, should be mutated to join the other “languages” of southern Yauyos, under the category Central Yungay. The four sets should, further, be collapsed and the resulting set called Southern Yauyos. The revised (pruned) tree would then be as in Figure~\ref{Fig1rev}. In the event that it be necessary to honor the internal diversity that would be obscured by this move, note may simply be made to the fact that this “new” language counts multiple dialects. In this case, Cacra-Hongos and San Pedro de Huacarpana would have to be listed among these.\footnote{I regret having to list Laraos independently here, as I believe it is possible to make a convincing argument for its inclusion as a dialect of Southern Yauyos. Nothing in this volume, however, directly speaks to that question. I plan to address it explicitly in a future paper.}",Fig1rev,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Introduction\label{ch:introduction,A note to Quechuanists and typologists\label{sec:notetoquechuanists,,,,Those already familiar with Quechuan languages will likely be interested in the tables and sections listed in Tables~\ref{tab:tabinterestq} and~\ref{tab:secinterestq} immediately below. These indicate differences between Southern Yauyos Quechua and other Quechuan languages as well as differences among the various dialects of \SYQ. The footnotes appearing in these sections may be of interest as well. Those familiar with the literature on Quechuan languages will immediately recognize the presentation and analysis here as very much derivative of much previous work on those languages.\\,tab:tabinterestq,Not found,tab:secinterestq,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

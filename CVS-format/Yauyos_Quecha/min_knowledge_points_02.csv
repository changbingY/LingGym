Orthography rather strictly follows pronunciation in the case of consonants in both indigenous and borrowed words; in the case of vowels in borrowed words, it is something of an idealization (\ie,~it should not in these cases be mistaken for phonetic transcription).",Tab4,Not found,Tab5,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Phonology and morphophonemics\label{ch:Phono and morpho,Spanish loan words\label{sec:spanish loan\index[sub]{loan words,Loan word orthography,,,"This alphabet does not include the letters c, j, z, e or o, all of which occur in the original Spanish spelling of many borrowed words. Spanish c, j and z have been replaced with their \SYQ{} phonetic equivalents: “hard” c is replaced with k; “soft” c with s; j with h; and z with s. Thus, the borrowed Spanish words \spanish{\pb{c}a\pb{j}a} (‘box’, ‘coffin’) and \spanish{\pb{c}erve\pb{z}a} (‘beer’) are rendered \phono{\pb{k}a\pb{h}a} and \phono{\pb{s}irbi\pb{s}a}, with no change in the pronunciation of the relevant consonants in either case. Spanish e and o, appearing simply, are replaced with i and u (\spanish{c\pb{o}mpadr\pb{e}}~→~\phono{k\pb{u}mpadr\pb{i}}). Spanish vowel sequences including e and \spanish{o} are replaced as shown in Table~\ref{tab:lw orth}.",tab:lw orth,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

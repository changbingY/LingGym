Nouns,Gender,Gender assignment,,,"There are plenty of semantic and formal clues to gender assignment in Palula.

Those nouns, as is the case for other nouns denoting humans and higher animates, are indeed assigned gender according to meaning~-- masculine gender if male, and feminine if female, a~phenomenon we refer to as semantic gender assignment \citep[7--32]{corbett1991}. For the word `horse, stallion', we can similarly draw the conclusion that it is a~masculine noun (especially if we are told that another word is used to refer to a~mare). The other three words, referring to either lower animates, inanimate objects or phenomena, have also~-- some way or another~-- been assigned to one of the two genders: hiimaál and phúti are feminine nouns and ɡhoóṣṭ is a~masculine noun.

According to \citet[222]{masica1991}, this -aka- (in the nominative singular -akas) has been subject to weakening via \textit{-akō {\textgreater} -aɡō {\textgreater} -ahu {\textgreater} -au}, ending up as -ō or \textit{-\={a}} in many NIA languages. That may be so, but I also hold it for very likely that this rather major group of masculine nouns has been further expanded through analogy with the aka-derived nouns, some of them possibly with an~adjectival origin.

Adjectives and quantifiers,The adjective and its properties,,,,"Before dealing in more depth with semantic (\sectref{sec:6-2}) and morphological (\sectref{sec:6-3}) properties of adjectives, something will be said about their distribution and phonological structure. Normally adjectives do the job of modifying nouns, as in example (\ref{ex:6-1}), or that of descriptive predication, as in (\ref{ex:6-2}).",ex:6-1,\gll líi bíiḍ-i \textbf{ɡéeḍ-i} rusóx léed-i | \gls 3SG.DIST.OBL very-F big-F power find.PFV-F | \glt `He gained very much power.',ex:6-2,\gll pirsaahíb \textbf{ǰáand-u} de | \gls Pir.Sahib alive-MSG was | \glt `Pir Sahib [a pious man] was [still] alive.',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Adjectives and quantifiers,The adjective and its properties,,,,"Structurally, inflected adjectives have a~lot in common with nouns and some of the most common finite verb forms (those historically based on participles).

Adjectives and quantifiers,Morphological properties of adjectives,Comparison of degree,,,"As we saw above, there are some traces of an~earlier inflection for comparison, and \citet[17]{morgenstierne1941} also points out some remains of the OIA superlative degree, but in the modern language these degrees are exclusively expressed periphrastically. The comparative is expressed by a~standard of comparison in oblique case and the postposition díi `from', as illustrated in (\ref{ex:6-7}) and (\ref{ex:6-8}), preceding the adjective functioning as the parameter of comparison, literally translatable as `X is large from Y'.",ex:6-7,\gll bhiúuṛi \textbf{dhamareet-á} \textbf{díi} \textbf{ɡáaḍ-u} déeš | \gls Biori Dhamaret-OBL from large-MSG village | \glt `Biori is a~larger village than Dhamaret.',ex:6-8,\gll \textbf{kúuk-a} \textbf{díi} kúuk-e putr \textbf{hušiaár} | \gls crow-OBL from crow-GEN son wise | \glt `The son of a~crow is wiser than the crow [himself].',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

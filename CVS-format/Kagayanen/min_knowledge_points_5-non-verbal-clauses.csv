Non-verbal clauses,Predicate nominals,,,,"In the case of equative clauses, it is often difficult or impossible to determine which element is the argument and which is the predicate, since of course the equality relationship is symmetric. In general we can say that the argument is likely to be the \isi{discourse topic} (see, e.g., \citealt{givon2001-2}), and the predicate is a comment on that \isi{topic}. For example, if the topic of conversation is “Pedro,” then a sentence like \REF{bkm:Ref442630001} would be a Predicate+Argument structure. On the other hand, if the topic of conversation were “my cousin”, the same sentence would have the pragmatically marked Argument+Predicate structure ‘As for my cousin (he) is Pedro.’ This would likely be used if the speaker wished to contrast the equality of Pedro and the cousin with a different idea held by the hearer, for example, ‘Pedro is my brother,’ or ‘Juan is my cousin.’\is{equation|)}",bkm:Ref442630001,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, prepositional phrases with parti or tenged ‘about’ may occur in a non-verbal clause (\ref{bkm:Ref246297918} and \ref{ex:fish}).

Non-verbal clauses,Existential constructions,Basic existential constructions,,,"There are two existential particles in Kagayanen which collaborate to define three existential constructions. The two forms are may ‘indefinite existential particle’\is{indefinite existential particle}\is{existential particles!indefinite}, and anen, the ‘given existential particle\is{given existential particle}\is{existential particles!given}’. May without anen defines the indefinite new \is{indefinite new existential construction}\is{existential constructions!indefinite new}existential construction \REF{bkm:Ref329888024}. This construction introduces a participant for the first time into the discourse, “out of the blue” so to speak. Anen without may defines the definite given existential construction\is{definite given existential construction}\is{existential constructions!definite given} \REF{bkm:Ref329888060}-\REF{bkm:Ref442643960}, which asserts the presence of a particular referent that the speaker assumes the hearer can identify, and is probably aware of at the moment of speaking. In addition, may and anen may co-occur to form what we identify as the indefinite given existential construction\is{indefinite given existential construction}\is{existential constructions!indefinite given} \REF{bkm:Ref329888090}. This construction is used when the speaker presupposes that the hearer is thinking about, or is aware of some defined group of referents (e.g. ‘men’), but cannot identify the particular referent or subgroup of referents being singled out. In the following examples, the English free translations ‘some N’ or ‘some Ns’ are used to refer to the argument in an indefinite, given construction, though this is not a fully adequate translation. For instance, \REF{bkm:Ref329888090} below may be the answer to a question such as “Are there any men here?” The question refers to a set of possible referents, namely ‘men’, and the response implies that one or more of those are present, but the speaker does not think the hearer can identify which specific one or ones might be intended.

Non-verbal clauses,Existential constructions,Basic existential constructions,,,"\hspace*{-5.8pt}In the indefinite constructions (i.e., those with may), the argument is a “stripped” Referring Phrase\is{stripped Referring Phrases} in that it takes no demonstrative determiners, genitive pronouns, or demonstratives \REF{bkm:Ref329889347}-\REF{bkm:Ref442938671}. Also, it may not be replaced by a pronoun (see \citealt{miner1986} on the notion of “noun stripping” and its similarity to noun incorporation). However, it may take quantifiers, relative clauses, and other modifiers. This stripped argument is clearly not absolutive because it does not take determiners, and does not participate in syntactic processes, such as fronting and relativizability, that are allowed for absolutives. While the stripped argument is not absolutive, neither is it Oblique in that it does not take any of the Oblique prepositions (including the non-absolutive case marker ta) and it may not be fronted, as can Obliques. Thus the indefinite existential constructions are among the very few constructions in Kagayanen that do not require an absolutive constituent. Another salient characteristic of the two \isi{indefinite existential constructions} is that they serve as the bases for a type of predicative possession\is{predicative!possession} in which the possessed item is the stripped argument, and a possessor occurs as a distinct absolutive referring expression (see \sectref{sec:predicativepossession} below).",bkm:Ref329889347,\gsrc May manakem na mama.

Verb structure and inflection,Inflection,,,,Contrast the paradigm in \REF{bkm:Ref59175832} with a family of words also based on the root do:,bkm:Ref59175832,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Verb structure and inflection,Inflection,,,,"The forms in \REF{bkm:Ref59176157} can be thought of as a partial \isi{word family} because they are all based on the same root. However, they are not a paradigm. There are several reasons this list of forms is not a \isi{paradigm}. First, they do not vary according to any coherent semantic dimension – their meanings are logically independent of one another: reversative, reiterative, ability, etc. Second, the meaning elements they express may combine with one another, for example undoable combines the notions of reversative and ability; redoable combines reiteration with ability. Forms such as un-redo, re-undo, and re-undoable, though perhaps odd-sounding out of context, are also conceivable members of this family. Third, none of the affixes that define a word family are required for the root to be used in discourse. Fourth, these forms do not have analogies for every English verb. For example forms like *resee, *unremember, *bleedable and many others are extremely difficult to find appropriate communicative contexts for. Finally, the forms undo and redo are verbs, just like the root do. As such, they also occur in the five possible inflectional forms for English verbs: undid, redoing, undone, redoes, undo, and so on. In other words, the affixes that define the word family may occur with each other, and with the inflectional forms in the paradigm.",bkm:Ref59176157,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Verb structure and inflection,Inflection,,,,"In contrast, the inflections, as given in \REF{bkm:Ref59175832}, are mutually exclusive – a form cannot logically express present tense and past tense at the same time; 3\textsuperscript{rd} person singular and non-3\textsuperscript{rd} person singular at the same time, and so on. Thus forms with multiple inflections are impossible: *diding, *doinged, *done-ing, *dids, *dones, etc. Note that these forms are strictly uninterpretable; they do not just “sound odd out of context” the way un-redo and re-undo might.",bkm:Ref59175832,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They all have different, though related, meanings. Note that the morphological processes that give rise to these forms (pa-, ng-, -an, -ay and reduplication) may combine with one another to produce even more complex forms, as illustrated in the last three examples in \REF{bkm:Ref59345903}. These stem-forming morphological processes\is{stem-forming morphology}, and others, are a rich resource available to Kagayanen speakers to create complex and nuanced meanings.",bkm:Ref59345903,Not found,bkm:Ref59345903,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Verb structure and inflection,Inflectional affixation,Grammatical transitivity,,,"There is a difference between \isi{semantic transitivity}\is{transitivity!semantic} and grammatical transitivity. Semantic transitivity has to do with situations being communicated, whereas grammatical transitivity has to do with grammatical structures used to depict those situations. The two types of transitivity do not necessarily coincide. For example, English constructions such as she already ate, or he drank of the water of bitterness present semantically transitive\is{semantic transitivity}\is{transitivity!semantic} situations (someone eating or drinking something) in grammatically intransitive constructions (there is no direct object). Something similar occurs in Kagayanen. Situations that seem to require an Undergoer and a distinct Controller may be expressed in an intransitive construction, with the Undergoer simply omitted or presented in the non-absolutive case, preceded by ta or ki. We describe such constructions as detransitive\is{detransitive constructions}. Such constructions are used when there is an Undergoer, but it is less salient in the communicative situation than the Actor in some way. The Actor is presented as the most affected participant, and the Undergoer, if present at all, is presented as less central in some way, either by being indefinite, non-specific, incompletely affected, and so on. Of course, the big difference between English and Kagayanen is that English does not mark grammatical transitivity on the verb, whereas Kagayanen does. The verb eat is the same whether it occurs in a transitive (SUBJ eats OBJ) or intransitive (SUBJ eats) frame. In Kagayanen, however, the verb in a detransitive construction is explicitly marked as intransitive. Examples \REF{bkm:Ref118364790} and \REF{bkm:Ref125017724} illustrate detransitive constructions from the corpus.

Verb structure and inflection,Conversational omission of inflectional affixes,,,,"It is clear that this omission of prefixes is “optional” for two reasons. First, such omission never results in ambiguity—speakers are always able to supply the missing form based on contextual factors. Second, sometimes inflectional prefixes do appear in these contexts, with no apparent variation in meaning. A full discourse study may be needed to determine whether there is a consistent pattern as to when prefixes are omitted versus when they are retained. Since most of the examples in this grammar are from natural texts, many have omitted prefixes. We have not edited or flagged these in any way, unless the omission is important to the point being illustrated in the example.

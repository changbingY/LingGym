Modification,Introduction,,,,"Example \REF{bkm:Ref441656793-a} is a complete, grammatical sentence that is likely to evoke a certain scene in the minds of English speakers. However, the scene depicted is very vague and, frankly, uninteresting. In a Western context there may be a table and chairs, at least two diners and some unspecified food, but little else “on stage”. On the other hand, a construction like \REF{bkm:Ref441656793-b} evokes a much more enriched version of possibly the same scene. Now we have a better idea of what kind and quality of food may be present, something about the surroundings, the presence of servers, money, the approximate time that this event is alleged to have occurred, and also the speaker’s attitude toward this scene (“honestly”). The scene is still vague, to be sure. We don’t know, for example, how many other diners were present, exactly what menu items were ordered, and so on. Nevertheless, \REF{bkm:Ref441656793-b} is much more explicit and communicative than \REF{bkm:Ref441656793-a}.",bkm:Ref441656793-a,Not found,bkm:Ref441656793-b,Not found,bkm:Ref441656793-b,Not found,bkm:Ref441656793-a,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,
Modification,Introduction,,,,"The difference between \REF{bkm:Ref441656793-a} and \REF{bkm:Ref441656793-b} is mostly modification. First there is modification of the noun “dinner”. This very general notion has been restricted to a certain class of dinners, those portrayed by the speaker as “the best”, “new” and``Italian” similarly enrich the scene by modifying the noun “restaurant”. Then there are modifying elements that restrict the scene to a place (“at a new Italian restaurant”) and a time (“last night”). Finally, there is one modifying element that specifies the speaker’s attitude toward the speech act itself (“honestly”). None of this information is technically required by the grammar, but all of it enriches and clarifies the scene in ways that make it more consistent with the communicative intentions of the speaker.\is{discourse scenes|)}\is{scenes|)}",bkm:Ref441656793-a,Not found,bkm:Ref441656793-b,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Modification,Introduction,,,,"In Kagayanen, modifying elements occur in many construction types. In this chapter we describe elements and constructions that serve as modifiers within the Referring Phrase (\sectref{bkm:Ref422117197}{}-\ref{bkm:Ref52774536}), the Modifier Phrase (\sectref{bkm:Ref418142991}), the Predicate (\sectref{bkm:Ref420904083}), and the Clause (\sectref{bkm:Ref441599506} and \sectref{bkm:Ref481473714}).\is{modification|)}",bkm:Ref52774536,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Modification,Adjectives,,,,"The grammar of Kagayanen treats adjectives and nouns similarly, in both the attributive and predicative usages. For example, the bare forms of prototypical nouns\is{nouns!prototypical}, like baļay ‘house’, and prototypical property concept words, like bakod ‘big’, can both function as the Head of a Referring Phrase (examples in \ref{ex:bighouse}, and as the main predicator in a non-verbal predication \is{predicative!use of nouns}(examples in \ref{bkm:Ref422575828}; see also \chapref{chap:non-verbalclauses}):",bkm:Ref422575828,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, a relative clause structure more commonly expresses the idea of ‘house made of wood’ \REF{bkm:Ref422580186-c}. Some other “material composition” words may directly modify the head of an RP, as shown in \REF{bkm:Ref422580415}:",bkm:Ref422580186-a,Not found,bkm:Ref422580189-a,Not found,bkm:Ref422580186-b,Not found,bkm:Ref422575828-b,Not found,bkm:Ref422575828-c,Not found,bkm:Ref422580186-c,Not found,bkm:Ref422580415,Not found,,,,,,

Modification,Adjectives,,,,"The exact patterns of which nouns can modify which other nouns seem to be lexically determined. Perhaps some noun-noun pairs in which one noun modifies the other are compound words (\ref{bkm:Ref422581440}). However, we have no independent reason for calling these compounds. They exhibit the same intonational characteristics and variability as Referring Phrases, and their meanings are as compositional and transparent as those of ordinary RPs. Furthermore, the fact that the order of elements may be reversed, as in most modifier+noun constructions, is an argument against the analysis of these noun-noun pairs as lexicalized compounds. The point of these illustrations, however, is to show that property concept words can always be Modifiers or Heads of RPs, while referring words (nouns) can always be Heads, but only sometimes Modifiers of RPs. This is one subtle grammatical property that distinguishes \isi{adjectives} and \isi{nouns}.",bkm:Ref422581440,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Modification,Adjectives,,,,"*tise nang bayo na gisi\footnote{The word tise as a noun modifier means small in number or size. As a modifier of a gradable quality, such as spoiled, red or smelly, it means slightly. As a modifier of an activity it means almost (see \sectref{bkm:Ref480610640}). The word sise means small in size. But sometimes Kagayanen speakers use these two words interchangeably. When the word tise means small in number (‘a few’), or a little bit of a quality, as in example \REF{bkm:Ref441658460}, then it is always followed by nang. In its other usages, nang is optional. The form tise (nang), like most adverbial elements, may also function as a noun modifier. However, in that case the linker na is required: tise nang na bayo ‘a few clothes’, ‘small clothes’. This usage, however, is far less common than the usage as a degree adverb.}",bkm:Ref441658460,\gll tise nang baļ{}-es na kan-en | \gls little just spoiled LK cooked.rice | \glt ‘slightly spoiled cooked rice’,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Modification,Adjectives,,,,"Finally, the last morphosyntactic property that may be said to distinguish a word class of adjectives is that this class can be the target of certain word-forming patterns. The resulting forms may function as Heads of RPs, Modifiers of RPs, or as non-verbal Predicators. Furthermore, most of them may occur with intensity and degree adverbs (examples in \ref{bkm:Ref422804351}), and so may be considered true adjectives.

For partial reduplication, the first consonant and vowel are reduplicated, and if the root ends in a consonant, the final consonant is also reduplicated. All roots that reduplicate allow complete reduplication, but not all allow partial reduplication.

Also, it is functioning at a higher, discourse level, as a disjunct adverb (see \sectref{bkm:Ref441599506} above).

Also, unlike other oblique elements these structures never occur with a complex preposition---the marker is always and only ta. These prepositional adverbs\is{prepositional adverbs} tend to express the extent, degree or value of the action, as listed in \REF{bkm:Ref441309255}.",bkm:Ref441309255,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Modification,Adverbs,Locative adverbs,,,"The unmarked position for locative adverbs is post-verbal, either before or after the first noun phrase (\ref{bkm:Ref52348615}{}-\ref{bkm:Ref113439285}). Personal pronouns and shorter adverbs occur before the locative adverb. An oblique location phrase with the definite spatial marker naan and a noun can occur clause-finally further specifying the location (\ref{bkm:Ref52439592}).",bkm:Ref52348615,\gsrc Tukad danen \textbf{dya}.

Modification,Adverbs,Locative adverbs,,,"Locative adverbs and the definite spatial oblique marker naan sometimes occur together, for example, naan dya. However, when a general locative adverb is in the pragmatically marked pre-verbal position, then naan must occur before it (exx. \ref{bkm:Ref52439592}{}-\ref{bkm:Ref52439595}). When the spatial marker and the locative adverb are pre-verbal, any clitic pronouns and clitic adverbs must also occur in pre-verbal position (\ref{bkm:Ref52439592}).",bkm:Ref52439592,"\gsrc Naan kay \textbf{dya} gakitaay kay, kami Maria daw Neneng naan Gaisano. | \gll Naan kay \textbf{dya} ga-kita-ay kay, kami Maria daw Neneng naan Gaisano. | \gls SPAT.DEF 1P.LEXCL.ABS D4LOC I.R-see-REC 1P.EXCL.ABS 1P.EXCL.ABS Maria and Neneng SPAT.DEF Gaisano | \glt ‘(It was) there we met each other, I and Maria and Neneng, in Gaisano.’",bkm:Ref52439595,Not found,bkm:Ref52439592,"\gsrc Naan kay \textbf{dya} gakitaay kay, kami Maria daw Neneng naan Gaisano. | \gll Naan kay \textbf{dya} ga-kita-ay kay, kami Maria daw Neneng naan Gaisano. | \gls SPAT.DEF 1P.LEXCL.ABS D4LOC I.R-see-REC 1P.EXCL.ABS 1P.EXCL.ABS Maria and Neneng SPAT.DEF Gaisano | \glt ‘(It was) there we met each other, I and Maria and Neneng, in Gaisano.’",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Modification,Adverbs,Locative adverbs,,,One difference between the distribution of general and precise locative adverbs is that with the precise forms the definite spatial oblique marker naan is optional when in preverbal position and usually does not occur.

Modification,Prepositional Phrases,,,,"In this section we will treat prepositional phrases (non-absolutive constituents expressing oblique elements) as optional clause-level modifiers, similar to \isi{adjunct adverbs}\is{adverbs!adjunct}. Prepositional phrases consist minimally of an oblique case-marked RP, that is, an RP with one of the \isi{oblique} case particles, ki for personal names or ta for all other head nouns (see \chapref{chap:referringexpressions}, \sectref{sec:caseinreferringexpressions}). Spatial prepositional phrases\is{spatial Prepositional Phrases}\is{Prepositional Phrases!spatial} may also contain the \isi{spatial definite particle} naan (variants yaan, nyaan, or an), and an optional spatial preposition\is{prepositions!spatial|(} (PREP) before the RP.

Modification,Prepositional Phrases,,,,"Nearly all the spatial prepositions (listed in \ref{bkm:Ref329066261}) transparently derive from relational nouns, that is, nouns that specify a relational term, such as top, bottom, side, inside, outside, and so on.

They also may indicate certain logical relations.",bkm:Ref329066261,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Modification,Prepositional Phrases,,,,"The definite demonstrative naan can also occur without a spatial preposition, in which case the meaning is general location---‘in’, ‘at’, or ‘on’. In such cases, the non-absolutive marker ta or ki often drops out, suggesting that naan is almost grammaticalized as a third oblique case marker\is{oblique case markers} (exx. \ref{bkm:Ref480787107}{}-\ref{bkm:Ref52441569}).

Nominal morphology,Noun classes,,,,"Fwe nouns are divided into genders, which are commonly referred to as noun classes in Bantu linguistics. Fwe uses 19 noun classes, which are numbered 1-18 (including 1a) according to the Bantu tradition. Noun class agreement is marked on modifiers, as discussed in \sectref{bkm:Ref74305906}, and on verbs, as discussed in Chapter \ref{bkm:Ref98512234}.

As the prefix r(i)- is lost when the noun is used in class 6 to mark a plural, the initial segment r(i)- can be analyzed as a prefix of class 5. The presence of /i/ in this allomorph cannot be proven, as the combination of the putative /i/ of the nominal prefix and the following /i/ of the nominal stem may account for the deletion of the initial /i/.

Morphophonological changes that accompany this prefix have been discussed in \sectref{bkm:Ref451507060}.

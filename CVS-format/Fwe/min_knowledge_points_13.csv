Syntax and information structure,,,,,"Various issues in the syntax of Fwe have already been discussed in previous chapters: the marking of subjects and (multiple) objects in Chapter \ref{bkm:Ref99105339}, the syntactic behavior of arguments introduced by the causative or applicative derivation in Chapter \ref{bkm:Ref99105347}, the use of copulative prefixes to mark non-verbal predication in \sectref{bkm:Ref489963307}, to name a few. This chapter discusses remaining issues in the syntax of Fwe. \sectref{bkm:Ref492315922} discusses the canonical word order in Fwe, and Sections \ref{bkm:Ref403656711} and \ref{bkm:Ref452042958} discuss pragmatically motivated derivations from this order. In \sectref{bkm:Ref491361275} locative inversion is discussed, which involves the use of a locative constituent as a syntactic subject. \sectref{bkm:Ref75346027} discusses a number of dependent clause types, including relative clauses. \sectref{bkm:Ref491333435} discusses cleft constructions, which combine nominal predication with a relative clause to mark constituent focus.",bkm:Ref99105339,Not found,bkm:Ref99105347,Not found,bkm:Ref403656711,Not found,bkm:Ref452042958,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,
Syntax and information structure,Canonical word order,,,,"Constituent order in Fwe depends on three factors; the syntactic function of the constituent, that is if it functions as a subject, object, (inflected) verb, or a locative adjunct or adverb; the information structural properties of the constituent, whether it is in focus, topicalized, or marked for definiteness; and the clause type, either main or subordinate. The canonical, unmarked order of constituents in a main clause in Fwe is SVO, as illustrated in (\ref{bkm:Ref449629903}); note that, while such clauses can easily by elicited, in actual discourse it is likely for the subject, the object, or both to be expressed pronominally rather than as as nominal constituents.",bkm:Ref449629903,\gsrc òmùsá nàhíbí ènjìngà yángù | \gll o-mu-sá na-hib-í̲ e-N-jinga i-angú | \gls AUG-NP1-thief SM1.PST-steal-NPST.PFV AUG-NP9-bicycle PP9-POSS1SG | {}[Subject] [Verb] {[ Object ]},,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Though only one element (either the subject or the object) is clefted, the entire construction is interpreted as being in focus. This is illustrated in (\ref{bkm:Ref449701908}); the context for this utterance is that a noise was heard, and the speaker was asked what happened. Neither the breaking nor the fact that it was a cup that broke are known to the hearer, yet only the cup is marked as the clefted element, and the verb expressing the breaking, though equally focal, is expressed in the relative clause.",bkm:Ref449701908,\gsrc njìnkómókí yàpwàcûkì | \gll nji-N-komokí i-a-pwacú̲k-i | \gls COP9-NP9-cup SM9-PST-break-NPST.PFV | \glt ‘A cup broke.’,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Syntax and information structure,Cleft constructions,,,,"In order to focus a verb, a fronted-infinitive construction (FIC) is used, which is essentially a cleft construction in which the inflected verb is copied as an infinitive and clefted. The infinitive form which forms the clefted element is an infinitive, which behaves like a noun of class 15. As the infinitive functions as a clefted element, it is marked with a copulative prefix, which is realized as zero before a voiceless consonant (see \sectref{bkm:Ref489963307} on the form of copulatives), as in (\ref{bkm:Ref99109592}). The copula also has a form which is used on definite constituents, and for class 15, this form of the copula is (n)kó-. This definite copula can also be used to mark the infinitive in a FIC, as in (\ref{bkm:Ref99109635}).",bkm:Ref99109592,\gsrc kùshèkà báꜝshékà | \gll ∅-ku-shek-a bá̲-shek-á̲ | \gls COP-NP15-laugh-FV SM2.REL-laugh-FV | \glt ‘They laugh.’,bkm:Ref99109635,\gsrc kókùmànà ndíꜝmánà | \gll kó-ku-man-a ndí̲-man-á̲ | \gls COP.DEF-NP15-finish-FV SM1SG.REL-finish-FV | \glt ‘I just finished.’,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Negation,Negation of indicative verb forms,,,,"Indicative verb forms are negated with a pre-initial prefix ka- or ta-, and the final vowel suffix -i.

However, when the passive suffix -(i)w is separated from the final vowel by the occurrence of the habitual suffix -ang, the negative suffix -i is used, as in (\ref{bkm:Ref505773694}).

Both forms use a suffix \-–i, neither of which ever causes spirantization (as opposed to certain other suffixes with /i/, where spirantization is attested in lexicalized cases). Both forms use melodic tone 3, which is assigned to the second stem syllable.

Negation,Negation of indicative verb forms,,,,"The negative prefix ta-/ka- is placed directly before the subject marker of the verb. When the subject marker consists of a vowel only, vowel hiatus resolution takes place between the vowel of the negative prefix and the vowel of the subject marker. Aside from subject markers affected by predictable rules of vowel hiatus resolution, there are no special forms of subject markers used exclusively with negative verbs, as opposed to a tendency often observed in Bantu languages for subject markers of the first person singular to have a special negated form: the negated form of the first person singular is a morphologically regular combination of the negative prefix with the first person singular subject marker ndi-, as in (\ref{bkm:Ref74909320}).",bkm:Ref74909320,\gsrc tàndìbútùkì (cf. ndìbùtúkà ‘I run’) | \gll ta-ndi-bú̲tuk-i | \gls NEG-SM1SG-run-NEG | \glt ‘I don’t run.’,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Negation,Negation of indicative verb forms,,,,"Verbs in the stative construction are also negated with the prefix ka-/ta-, combined with lengthening of the last vowel of the verb, which is not seen in the affirmative stative. This can be seen as influence from the negative suffix -i, which contributes an extra mora to the last vowel of the verb, but its vowel quality merges with the last vowel of the verb (/e/ or /i/, depending on the allomorph of the stative suffix, see \sectref{bkm:Ref431984198}).

Negated stative verbs take a high tone on the last mora of the verb (MT 1, see \sectref{bkm:Ref71540433}). The deletion of the lexical tone of the root, as seen in the affirmative stative, also affects the negated stative. Optional high tone spread, i.e. the copying of high tones up to the first syllable of the verb stem, is never seen in negated stative verbs, though it is very common in affirmative stative verbs.

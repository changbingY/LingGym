Tone is discussed in Chapter \ref{bkm:Ref451507583}, which also explains transcription conventions of tones used throughout this book. Earlier sketches of the phonology of Fwe can be found in {\citet{Baumbach1997}} and {\citet{Seidel2005}}, who describe the Namibian variety of Fwe, and {\citet{Bostoen2009}}, who describes the Zambian variety.

Segmental phonology,Vowels,Automatic vowel lengthening,,,"Lengthening of /a/ before alveolar fricatives is the last step in a process of sound change and ana\-logical extension very similar to what is described for Ganda \citep{Hyman2003a}. In Ganda, a causa\-tive suffix -i caused spirantization of the last consonant of the root of the verb to /s/. The vowel /i/ of the causative was subsequently absorbed into the preceding consonant, combined with compensatory lengthening of the final vowel -a of the verb. In other verbs ending in /sa/, where no causative morphology is present, the lengthening was added in analogy with the lengthen\-ing in causative verbs. A similar process appears to have taken place in Fwe, where an earlier causa\-tive suffix *i also triggered spirantization of the previous consonant to /s/ or /z/, leading to the loss of /i/ and compensatory lengthening.\footnote{In Ganda, this process involved glide formation from /i/ to /y/ \citep{Hyman2003a}. In Fwe, there is no clear evidence for glide formation, e.g. no causative verbs are attested where /s/ is followed by /y/. It is possible that glide formation historically took place, and that the glide was subsequently lost, as Fwe does not allow (or no longer allows) combinations of /s/ and /y/ (see \sectref{bkm:Ref451940391} on co-occurrence restrictions).} Although this process is no longer productive in Fwe, examples such as (\ref{bkm:Ref98514649}) and (\ref{bkm:Ref98514652}) show that the change of a final stem consonant to /s/ or /z/ was part of causative formation (see \sectref{bkm:Ref451514620} for more examples).",bkm:Ref98514649,\ea | \glll kùtùkùtà | \gll ku-tukut-a | \gls INF-become_warm-FV,bkm:Ref98514652,\ea | \glll kùhârà | \gll ku-hár-a | \gls INF-live-FV,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Segmental phonology,Morphophonology,Vowel harmony,,,"Fwe has borrowed verbs from Lozi, a neighboring Bantu language that lacks vowel harmony, and where the causative is invariably realized as -is and the applicative as -el. In some of these Lozi borrowings, such as those in (\ref{bkm:Ref98929082}) and (\ref{bkm:Ref98929085}), the rules of vowel harmony do not apply as they do to native Fwe verbs, suggesting these were borrowed from Lozi as complex verbs which include a derivational suffix. This is supported by the fact that many borrowed Lozi verbs only occur with the derivational suffix, and never without it.",bkm:Ref98929082,\gsrc kùràtèrèrà (borrowed from Lozi ku latelela ‘to follow’) | \gll ku-rat-er-er-a | \gls INF-follow-INT-FV | \glt ‘to follow’\\,bkm:Ref98929085,\gsrc kùsèpìsà (borrowed from Lozi ku sepisa ‘to promise’) | \gll ku-sep-is-a | \gls INF-trust-CAUS-FV | \glt ‘to promise’,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Segmental phonology,Morphophonology,Vowel harmony,,,"The second type of vowel harmony, back vowel harmony, affects derivational suffixes with a back vowel /u/, the separative suffixes -ur (transitive) -uk (intransitive). These suffixes are realized with a mid vowel /o/ when used with a verb stem with a mid back vowel /o/, but not when used with a verb stem with a front mid vowel /e/, as in (\ref{bkm:Ref448244057}).",bkm:Ref448244057,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Segmental phonology,Morphophonology,Nasal harmony,,,"In addition to vowel harmony, certain derivational suffixes in Fwe are also subject to nasal harmony. Nasal harmony affects all derivational suffixes with a consonant /r/: the applica\-tive -ir, as in (\ref{bkm:Ref98929486}), the transitive separative -ur, as in (\ref{bkm:Ref98929502}), and the (highly lexicalized) extensive \-\nobreakdash-ar, as in (\ref{bkm:Ref98929515}). The consonant /r/ of the suffix is changed to /n/ when preceded by a verb stem ending in a nasal consonant. Like vowel harmony, this type of nasal harmony is a common Bantu phenomenon \citep{Greenberg1951}.",bkm:Ref98929486,Not found,bkm:Ref98929502,Not found,bkm:Ref98929515,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Segmental phonology,Morphophonology,Nasal harmony,,,"Like vowel harmony, nasal harmony is only triggerd by the syllable immediately preceding the target. No nasal harmony takes place when nasal roots consonants are separated from the derivational suffix by a non-nasal consonant, as in (\ref{bkm:Ref489631913}), where the causative separating the root-final nasal /m/ from the applicative suffix -ir prevents the application of nasal harmony.",bkm:Ref489631913,\gsrc kùzìmìsìrà | \gll ku-zim-is-ir-a | \gls INF-be_extinguished-CAUS-APPL-FV | \glt ‘to extinguish for’,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Segmental phonology,Morphophonology,Nasal harmony,,,"Nasal harmony is also triggered by nasal conso\-nants in derivational suffixes, namely the intransitive impositive suffix -am.

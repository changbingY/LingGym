Verbal derivation,,,,,"Verbs in Fwe are morphologically highly complex, taking multiple derivational suffixes, discussed in this chapter, as well as complex inflectional morphology, discussed in chapters \ref{bkm:Ref100140368}-\ref{bkm:Ref100140375}. Verbal derivation in Fwe mainly makes use of suffixes, in addition to full and partial stem reduplication. Verbal derivational suffixes appear directly after the verb stem, and before inflectional suffixes. The rich verbal derivational morphology of Fwe is typical of Bantu languages, and most derivational suffixes are clear reflexes of common Bantu morphemes.",bkm:Ref100140368,Not found,bkm:Ref100140375,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Verbal derivation,,,,,"Derivational strategies differ in productivity. Some strategies are highly productive: they can be freely used to derive new verbs from a wide variety of existing verbs, have clear and regular semantic and syntactic functions, and most lexical verbs that can occur in a derived form also have an attested underived form. This the case for the passive, causative, applicative, and pluractional 2 (marked by stem reduplication). Given their high productivity, these suffixes tend to occur after other, less productive suffixes. The passive is always the last derivational suffix, even when combined with an equally productive causative, as in (\ref{bkm:Ref462826094}), or applicative, as in (\ref{bkm:Ref462826104}).",bkm:Ref462826094,\gsrc àzwìsìwâ | \gll a-zw-is-iw-á̲ | \gls SM1-leave-CAUS-PASS-FV | \glt ‘S/he was fired.’,bkm:Ref462826104,"\gsrc ècí cìpùrà ndìmè nàcápàngìrwà | \gll e-cí ci-pura ndi-me na-cí̲-a-pang-ir-w-a | \gls AUG-DEM.I7 NP7-chair COP-PERS1SG REM-SM7-PST-make-APPL-PASS-FV<REL> | \glt ‘The chair, it’s me that it was made for.’",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

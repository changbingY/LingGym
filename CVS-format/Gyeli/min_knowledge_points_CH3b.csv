Morphology,Morpheme types,Prefixes,Derivational prefixes,,"The {\itshape ná}- similative marker is the most lexicalized prefix in the language since its use is not productive. Instead, it is lexically specified which nouns and adjectives occur with this marker. Especially in the case of nouns with the {\itshape ná}- prefix, one could even argue that the prefix is synchronically frozen to the lexical stem since, in many instances, the meaning of the lexical stem is opaque. There are several reasons, however, why I consider {\itshape ná}- a prefix and not part of the lexical stem. First, nouns with the {\itshape ná}- prefix are structurally different from other common nouns. If one counted {\itshape ná}- as part of the nominal stem, some of these stems would have a syllable length of four syllables. As discussed in \sectref{sec:SyllN}, however, the maximum syllable length in stems is three syllables (and even this is dispreferred, accounting for only 10% of the nouns in the database). Second, the {\itshape ná}- prefix occurs quite frequently and regularly, especially in the derivation of female names from male names and in adjectives. This suggests that there is a formal pattern (rather than just a random CV syllable shape). Third, there is a clear function attributed to {\itshape ná}-, namely that of expressing similarity, as shown in the examples in \REF{SIMNouns}.

Where there is more than one object, only the object closest to the verb is marked by the object linker. As such, it is an inflectional morpheme that is obligatorily in this environment.

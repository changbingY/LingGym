Parts of speech,Nouns,Noun types,Nominalized past participles,,"Another hypothesis would be to consider these forms as verbs, given their verbal stem and translation. Despite significant differences from common nouns and proper names, I do not adopt this analysis, but instead classify nominalized past participles as a defective noun type. Evidence for this comes from their prefixation and tonal behavior, and their distribution in sentences which distinguishes them from verbs. Morphologically, verbs do not take prefixes, but only suffixes. The nominalized past participle, however, consistently takes a nasal prefix. Verbs only have tonal specifications for the first syllable while the potential second and third syllables are underlyingly toneless and thus surface as L in isolation, as explained in \sectref{sec:Tonology}. In contrast, nominalized past participles never surface L on the last syllables, but either H or HL. Also in terms of their distribution in sentences, nominalized past participle forms cannot be verbs since verbs follow the subject-tense-aspect-mood-polarity (\textsc{stamp}) marker, as described in \sectref{sec:SCOP}. These participles cannot combine with the \textsc{stamp} marker. They only occur in \textsc{stamp} copula constructions (\sectref{sec:COP}).

Complex clauses,Subordination,Relative clauses,Linkage of relative clauses,,"Gyeli does not have a distinct marker of relative clauses such as, for instance, relative pronouns. Instead, an attributive marker ({\ATT}) can be used to indicate the embedding relation between subordinate clause and modified noun phrase. This attributive marker, which agrees in gender with the head noun, is also used in noun + noun constructions, as discussed in \sectref{sec:ATT}. In most cases, however, the use of the attributive marker is optional so that a relative clause is often not marked by a dedicated morpheme. The circumstances under which speakers omit the attributive marker in contrast to using it are not clear. In the corpus, about half of the relative clauses appear with an attributive marker, as in \REF{REL4b}, and about half without, as in \REF{REL5}. Few generalizations can be made at this point as to what conditions the marker's appearance or omission. Both appearance and omission occur with attributive markers of all agreement classes, singular and plural. Further, attributive markers and their omission are found with all subject, object, and oblique noun phrases that are modified. Finally, the role that the head noun plays in the relative clause does not seem to be decisive for the appearance or omission of the attributive marker, since examples of both variants are found for cases where the head of the relative clause is the subject or any type of object of the relative clause, as I will show below.

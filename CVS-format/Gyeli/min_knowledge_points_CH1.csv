Introduction,The Gyeli language,,,,"The region in which Gyeli is spoken measures about 12,500km\textsuperscript{2} (which corresponds to about 4,800mi\textsuperscript{2}). Unlike many other languages in the world, especially in the Indo-European context with its national languages, Gyeli is neither the only (or predominant) language in the region nor restricted to one contiguous geographic area. Instead, Gyeli is one out of nine languages in the area as shown below in Map \ref{Fig:Gyeli-map}. Naturally, there is intensive language contact between the languages of the region. Gyeli speakers are shifting to the languages of their farmer neighbors, a trend which both fragments Gyeli into different dialects and contributes to the language's endangerment. I will discuss each of these aspects in turn in more detail below.",Fig:Gyeli-map,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Introduction,The Gyeli language,The language's name,,,"Speakers in the northern part of the Gyeli language zone call their language {\itshape Kola}, speakers in the central and southern part call it {\itshape Gyeli}, but it is nevertheless considered the same language. Accordingly, the speakers are called {\itshape Bagyeli} in the center and south, and {\itshape Bakola} in the north. Since the speech community on which I base this grammar is located in the southern-central part of the Gyeli/Kola language zone (see Map \ref{Fig:Gyeli-map}), I use the name {\itshape Gyeli} rather than {\itshape Kola}.",Fig:Gyeli-map,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Introduction,The Gyeli language,The language's name,,,"{\itshape Bagyeli} and {\itshape Bakola} are terms used both as endonym (the way a group calls itself) and exonym (the name used for a group by outsiders).\footnote{Groups such as the Mabi and Ngumba, both dialects of Kwasio, as well as the Bulu, seem to use these terms. Exonyms used by other groups such as the Yasa or Bakoko, as represented in Map \ref{Fig:Gyeli-map}, require further investigation since I was not in direct contact with them during my fieldwork. \citet[29-30]{renaud76} discusses exonyms as used by the Basaa, Bulu, Fang, Mabi, and Ngumba. They are all related to the terms ``Gyeli'' and ``Kola''.} There is, however, an alternate exonym used by all local Bantu neighbors, namely the French word pygmées ``Pygmies''. It seems to be a convenient cover term for short-sized hunter-gatherers in Central Africa, especially since people not familiar with the ethnic and linguistic situation in Central Africa usually associate more with the term ``Pygmy'' than with ``Bagyeli'' or ``Bakola''. I will, however, not use this term for several reasons. First, the term ``Pygmy'' generally has a pejorative connotation (although this is certainly not always implied by the Bantu farmer neighbors who use it). Second, it implies a certain homogeneity among such Central African forest foragers which is, in all reality, not existent. So-called ``Pygmy'' groups differ considerably in terms of language, type of contact with their farming neighbors, settlement patterns, and hunting techniques, just to mention a few differences.",Fig:Gyeli-map,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Introduction,Structure of the grammar and basic grammatical features,A quick guide to decoding glossed examples,,,"The verb stem is generally preceded by a ``\textsc{stamp}'' (subject-tense-aspect-mood-polarity) clitic, which encodes information about the subject person and gender agreement, tense, aspect, mood, and polarity, as seen in \REF{i}-\REF{iii} with {\itshape à}, {\itshape mɛ́}, and {\itshape bá}, respectively. While eastern and southern Bantu languages are known for their rich agglutinative morphology, often with distinct -CV- prefixes for each of these categories, Gyeli as a northwestern Bantu language displays restrictions in segmental morphemes preceding the verb stem. Conversely, Gyeli has a rich tonal morphology where the tonal combinations on the \textsc{stamp} clitic and the verb stem yield different tense-aspect-mood categories, as discussed in \chapref{sec:TAM}. H tones attaching to the right of the verb stem, as expressed by -\textsc{h} in the second line, encode the two past tenses ({\PST}1 and {\PST}2) in some environments or a realis mood in other environments. The realis mood is pervasive in example sentences and glossed as -\textsc{r}, as seen in \REF{i} through \REF{iii}.",i,\gsrc Màmbì{\capsub{S}} à dé{\capsub{V}} mántúà{\capsub{O}} | \gll Màmbì a dè-H H-ma-ntúà | \gls ∅1.PN 1.PST1 eat-R OBJ.LINK-ma6-mango | \glt `Mambi ate mangoes.',iii,Not found,i,\gsrc Màmbì{\capsub{S}} à dé{\capsub{V}} mántúà{\capsub{O}} | \gll Màmbì a dè-H H-ma-ntúà | \gls ∅1.PN 1.PST1 eat-R OBJ.LINK-ma6-mango | \glt `Mambi ate mangoes.',iii,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,

Introduction,Structure of the grammar and basic grammatical features,A quick guide to decoding glossed examples,,,"The subject is rarely expressed by a pronoun. Subject pronouns (see \sectref{sec:SBJPRO}) are glossed as \textsc{sbj} to clearly distinguish them from the \textsc{stamp} clitic, especially as most subject pronouns are segmentally identical to the \textsc{stamp} clitic of their agreement class.

Introduction,Structure of the grammar and basic grammatical features,A quick guide to decoding glossed examples,,,"The glossing of nouns deserves a detailed explanation. Each noun form belongs to an agreement class; Gyeli has nine agreement classes and six genders, as described in \chapref{sec:NP}. Agreement classes are established on the basis of agreement patterns reflected on dependent agreement targets which include, in Gyeli, the \textsc{stamp} clitic, subject, object, and possessor pronouns, some nominal modifiers, e.g. some numerals and other quantifiers, demonstratives, and attributive markers. The agreement class that a noun controls on its dependent targets is glossed with a digit from 1 through 9 preceding the noun stem, for instance {\itshape ntfúmò} `knife' in \REF{ii} is glossed as `\emptyset3.knife' as this noun triggers agreement in agreement class 3.",ii,\gsrc mɛ́ vúlɔ́ pɛ́mbɔ́ yî nà ntfúmò wã̂ | \gll mɛ-H vúlɔ-H pɛ́mbɔ́ yî nà ntfúmò w-ã̂ | \gls 1SG-PRS cut-R emptyset7.bread 7.DEM.PROX COM emptyset3.knife 3-POSS.1SG | \glt `I cut this bread with my knife.',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

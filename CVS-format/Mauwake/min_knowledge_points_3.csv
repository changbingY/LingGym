Interjections are not part of the normal clause structure, and they usually occur either sentence-initially or finally \REF{ex:3:x797}--\REF{ex:3:x800}. Some can also be placed between clauses in a coordinate sentence \REF{ex:3:x801}. The glosses given in \tabref{tab:3:interjections} for the interjections are just rough approximations.",ex:3:x797,"\gll \textbf{Aa}, kema=ko kir-ek-a-n \textbf{aa}! | \gls oh liver=NF turn-CNTF-PA-2s oh | \glt `Oh, if only you had changed your ways (lit: turned your liver)!'",ex:3:x800,"\gll Naap ma-emi om-em-ika-i-nan, \textbf{na}. | \gls thus say-SS.SIM cry-SS.SIM-be-Np-FU.2s INTJ | \glt `You must cry saying like that.'",ex:3:x801,"\gll Yo damol-al-e-m \textbf{oo}, fiker fufa iw-a-m \textbf{oo}. | \gls 1s.UNM bad-INCH-PA-1s oh kunai.grass old.grass enter-PA-1s oh | \glt ` Oh, I'm in a bad way, I am hiding among the grass.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

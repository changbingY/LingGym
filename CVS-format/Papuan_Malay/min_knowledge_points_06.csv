,Pronominal uses,Personal pronouns in inclusory {conjunction constructions,,,"As for the distinction of \isi{comitative} and inclusory \isi{conjunction} constructions, \citet[33]{Haspelmath.2007c} makes the following cross-linguistic observations. In a \isi{comitative} \isi{conjunction} construction, the \isi{conjunction} of “two set-denoting \textsc{np}s [{\ldots}] ‘\{A, B\} and \{C, D\}’ yields the set \{A, B, C, D\}” (\citeyear*[33]{Haspelmath.2007c}). In inclusory \isi{conjunction} constructions, by contrast, “some members of the second conjunct set are already included in the first conjunct set”; hence the result of the coordination is not the “union, but the \textitbf{unification} of the sets [such that] ‘\{A, B, C\} and \{B\}’ yields the set \{A, B, C\}” (\citeyear*[33]{Haspelmath.2007c}). This distinction also applies to Papuan Malay. While the constructions in (\ref{Example_6.26}) to (\ref{Example_6.29}) receive an inclusory reading, the \isi{comitative} ‘N1 \textitbf{dengang} ‘with’ \textsc{N2}’ \isi{conjunction} construction in (\ref{Example_6.32}) receives an additive reading.

,Adnominal uses,,,,"Adnominal pronouns are available for all person-number values, with the exception of the first person singular. This unexpected restriction may have to do with the function of the adnominally used pronouns which is to disambiguate the participants in a speech act, as discussed in detail throughout this section. It seems that Papuan Malay presumes addressees to have difficulties in identifying first person plural, second person and third person participants. To disambiguate the referents, the respective nouns can be modified with the appropriate pronouns. With first person singular referents, however, no such difficulties are expected. Hence, such referents do not need to be disambiguated, as demonstrated with the example in (\ref{Example_6.50}).\footnote{See also Bickel and Witzlack-Makarevich’s (\citeyear*[15]{Bickel.2008}) cross-linguistic study on “Referential scales and case alignment”, which shows that “first person singular is indeed often treated differently from other persons”.}",Example_6.50,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Adnominal uses,,,,"The utterances in (\ref{Example_6.50}) are part of a conversation between a mother and her son. As the family wants to go on a trip, the son wants to obtain a leave of absence from school. He is afraid, though, that his mother will not remind him in time to ask for this leave. In trying to soothe him, his mother tells him that she will remind him in time and that she will not depart without him. In doing so, the speaker alternatively refers to herself with the \isi{noun} \textitbf{mama} ‘mother’ and with first person singular \textitbf{sa} ‘\textsc{1sg}’. In this context, \textitbf{mama} ‘mother’ unambiguously refers to the speaker. Hence, there is no need to further disambiguate the referent by adding the first person singular \isi{pronoun}.",Example_6.50,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Adnominal uses,,,,"Some of the examples in Table \ref{Table_6.8} and Table \ref{Table_6.8a} do not readily translate into English, given that “personal determiners” in English are subject to constraints concerning their person-number values \citep[27]{Lyons.1999}. In English, only ``we'' and ``you (\textsc{pl})'' occur freely as determiners, while ‘you (\textsc{sg})’ occurs in exclamations only; the remaining pronouns do not have any determiner uses.\footnote{English examples are ``we teachers'', ``you students'', or ``you idiot'' \citep[451–442]{Lyons.1999}.} Other languages, however, are less constrained. In \ili{German}, for example, the first and second persons, both singular and plural, occur as determiners, while the third person does not (\citealt[142]{Lyons.1999}; see also \citealt[189]{Helmbrecht.2004}) for the determiner uses of personal pronouns). Along similar lines, in the Oslo dialect of \ili{Norwegian}, the female third person singular \isi{pronoun} functions as a determiner \citep{Johannessen.2006}. In addition, pronouns can occur as determiners with proper names in some \ili{Germanic} languages, such as \ili{German}, \ili{Icelandic}, and \ili{Norwegian}. In \ili{German} it is the first or second person singular pronouns \citep[264-269]{Roehr.2005}, in \ili{Icelandic} it is the third person singular and the first and second person plural pronouns \citep[218-224]{Sigursson.2006}, and in \ili{Northern Norwegian} it is the third person singular \isi{pronoun} \citep[581]{Matushansky.2008}. Still other languages are “completely unconstrained in this respect” \citep[142]{Lyons.1999}, as for instance \ili{Warlpiri} (\citealt{Hale.1973} in \citealt[142]{Lyons.1999}).",Table_6.8,Not found,Table_6.8a,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Papuan Malay also conforms to this cross-linguistic finding in that the associates are most often X’s family as in (\ref{Example_6.98}). Less commonly, X’s associates are friends or companions in a shared activity as in (\ref{Example_6.99}).

In \ili{Ternate Malay}, however, pronouns do not have adnominal functions {\citep[141]{Litamahuputty.2012}}.

,Existential clauses,One-argument existential clauses,,,"Definite or identifiable existential clauses also co-occur with prepositional phrases, such as the \isi{locational} phrase \textitbf{di situ} ‘there’ in ({\ref{Example_11.105}). This clause can be analyzed in two ways. One analysis is that of an \isi{existential clause} with a \isi{locational} adjunct which gives additional information about the theme’s current location. This analysis is substantiated by the contrastive example in ({\ref{Example_11.106}), in which \textitbf{situ} ‘\textsc{l.med}’ is fronted to the clause-initial position. This possibility of fronting the \isi{prepositional phrase} is typical for adjuncts. In ({\ref{Example_11.106}) the fronting serves to emphasize the location (concerning the rather common \isi{elision} of \isi{locative} \textitbf{di} ‘at’, see §\ref{Para_10.1.5}). An alternative analysis of ({\ref{Example_11.105}) is that of a \isi{prepositional predicate clause} with progressive reading. This analysis is substantiated with the (near) contrastive examples in ({\ref{Example_11.107}) to ({\ref{Example_11.109}). The example in ({\ref{Example_11.107}) presents a non\isi{verbal clause} in which \textitbf{di situ} ‘there’ serves as the predicate. The example in ({\ref{Example_11.108}) shows how a \isi{prepositional predicate clause} can undergo aspectual \isi{modification}, as for instance with the prospective ad\isi{verb} \textitbf{masi} ‘still’. The example in ({\ref{Example_11.109}) shows the progressive-marking function of existential \textitbf{ada} ‘exist’ in verbal clauses (see also §\ref{Para_5.4.1}). When presented with both analyses, however, one of the consultants rejected the first analysis. Instead this consultant maintained that \textitbf{ada} ‘exist’ in ({\ref{Example_11.105}) has the same function as \textitbf{masi} ‘still’ in ({\ref{Example_11.108}), namely to modify the prepositional predicate \textitbf{di situ} ‘there’.

Dis\isi{similarity} comparisons are typically formed with \textitbf{laing dari} ‘be different from’ as in ({\ref{Example_11.133}). They signal that the two participants are dissimilar in terms of their overall nature. If speakers want to indicate that the two participants diverge from each other in terms of specific attributes or features rather than their overall nature, they use a dis\isi{similarity} clause formed with \textitbf{beda dengang} ‘be different with’. This is demonstrated with the elicited example in ({\ref{Example_11.134}), which contrasts with the clause in ({\ref{Example_11.133}). Another example is the dis\isi{similarity} clause in ({\ref{Example_11.135}).

,Comparative clauses,Summary,,,"Identity-marking clauses express \isi{similarity} or dis\isi{similarity}. In \isi{similarity}\linebreak clauses the index is \textitbf{sama} ‘be same’ and the mark is \isi{comitative} \textitbf{dengang} ‘with’. In {dissimilarity} clauses, the index is \textitbf{laing} ‘be different’ in combination with the mark \textitbf{dari} ‘from’, or \textitbf{beda} ‘be different’ in combination with the mark \textitbf{dengang} ‘with’. Clauses formed with \textitbf{laing dari} ‘be different from’ indicate overall {dissimilarity}, whereas clauses with \textitbf{beda dengang} ‘be different from’ signal {dissimilarity} in terms of some specific features. In \isi{identity-marking} clauses the index follows the parameter, which is optional. The standard is typically encoded in a \isi{prepositional phrase}, with the \isi{preposition} serving as the mark of comparison. This scheme for \isi{identity-marking} clauses is illustrated in ({\ref{Example_11.138}). In \isi{similarity} clauses, the standard can also be encoded as the clausal subject together with the comparee, as shown in ({\ref{Example_11.139}).",Example_11.138,Not found,Example_11.139,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

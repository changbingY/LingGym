Moreover, the author agrees with \citet[35, 43]{Bisang.2009}, who argues that complexity is not limited to the \isi{morphology} or syntax of a language. Instead, complexity may instead be found in the pragmatic inferential system as applied to utterances in their discourse setting. Such ``hidden complexity'' is certainly a pertinent trait of Papuan Malay, as shown throughout this book. Two examples of hidden complexity are presented in (\ref{Example_1.1}) and (\ref{Example_1.2}). Due to the lack of morphosyntactic marking in Papuan Malay, a given construction can receive different readings, as illustrated in (\ref{Example_1.1}). Depending on the context, the \textitbf{kalo {\ldots} suda} ‘when/if {\ldots} already’ construction can receive a temporal or a counterfactual reading.\footnote{One anonymous reviewer suggests an alternative analysis for the example in (\ref{Example_1.1}). Rather than being ambiguous and exemplifying a case of ``hidden complexity'', the \textitbf{kalo {\ldots} suda} `when/if {\ldots} already' construction expresses an unspecified reason-consequence relation, with the context supplying the information on whether the reason has place.} Example (\ref{Example_1.2}) illustrates the pervasive use of \isi{elision} in Papuan Malay.

,Genetic affiliations\label{Para_1.2,"Papuan Malay, a distinct language within the Malay continuum\label{Para_1.2.3",,,"Third, shared ethnolinguistic identity with other Malay varieties: ethnolinguistically, Papuans typically identify with their respective indigenous vernacular languages, regardless as to whether or not they are still active speakers of that language. Beyond this local identity, they have a well-established, distinct identity as Papuans, especially vis-à-vis Indonesians from the western parts of Indonesia. This has largely to do with the ongoing Indonesian occupation (since 1963) and the negative attitudes that the Indonesian government and Indonesian institutions express toward Papuans and ``Papuaness'' and also toward Papuan Malay (for more details on language attitudes see §\ref{Para_1.5.2}). Vice versa, Papuan attitudes towards Indonesia and ``Indonesianess'' are also rather negative. (See for instance \citealt{Chauvel.2002}; \citealt{King.2004}.) Papuans summarize their distinct identity as follows: \textitbf{suku beda, bahasa beda, agama beda, adat beda} ‘(our) ethnicity is different, (our) language(s) is/are different, (our) religion is different, (and our) customs are different’. This statement was made to the author on numerous occasions during her stays in West Papua. This distinct ethnolinguistic identity vis-à-vis Papuan Malay is also evidenced by the names which Papuans use to refer to their language, names such as \textitbf{logat Papua} ‘Papuan speech variety’ or \textitbf{bahasa tanah} ‘home language’. Indonesian, by contrast, is always \textitbf{bahasa Indonesia} ‘Indonesian language’. These names for Papuan Malay not only indicate a strong, indigenous identification with their language. They also imply that Papuans are able to distinguish between their language and Indonesian \citep[19]{Scott.2008}.

Rumaropen transcribed 121 texts, and E. Onim 99 texts; each text was transcribed in a separate Word file. Using Indonesian orthography, both consultants transcribed the data as literally as possible, including hesitation markers, false starts, truncation, speech mistakes, and nonverbal vocalizations, such as laughter or coughing. Once a recording had been transcribed, I checked the transcription by listening to the recording. Transcribed passages which did not match with the recordings were double-checked with the consultants. After having checked the transcribed texts is this manner, I imported the Word files into Toolbox, a data management and analysis tool developed by \iai{SIL International}.\footnote{Toolbox is available at \url{http://www-01.sil.org/computing/toolbox/} (accessed 8 January 2016).} In Toolbox, I interlinearized the 220 texts into English and Indonesian and compiled a basic dictionary. Each text was imported into a separate Toolbox record, receiving the same record number as its respective WAV file (for details see §\ref{Para_1.11.4.1}).",Para_1.11.4.1,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,Present study\label{Para_1.11,Word list\label{Para_1.11.6,,,"The frame sentences, which are given in (\ref{Example_1.15}) and (\ref{Example_1.16}), were used alternatively and served two purposes. First, I anticipated that by repeating the target word within a larger sentence, L. Aweta would potentially be less influenced by B. Rumaropen’s pronunciation. This precaution was taken in case that the pronunciations of the two consultants differed, with one being from \ili{Sentani} and the other one from \ili{Sarmi}. Second, eliciting the target word as part of a larger sentence allowed me to analyze how some of the word-final segments were pronounced when they occurred in sentence final position and when they were followed by another word. This proved especially helpful in analyzing the realizations of the plosives and the rhotic when occurring in the word-final coda position (see §\ref{Para_2.1.1.1}, §\ref{Para_2.3.1.2}, and §\ref{Para_2.3.1.3} in \chapref{Para_2}).",Example_1.15,"\gll sa blum taw ko pu kata itu, kata ___ | \gls 1SG not.yet know 2SG POSS word D.DIST word ___ | \glt ‘I don’t yet know that word of yours, the word ___’",Example_1.16,"\gll ko pu kata ___ itu, sa blum taw | \gls 2SG POSS word ___ D.DIST 1SG not.yet know | \glt ‘that word ___ of yours, I don’t yet know (it)’",Para_2.1.1.1,Not found,Para_2.3.1.2,Not found,Para_2.3.1.3,Not found,,,,,,,,,,
,Present study\label{Para_1.11,Word list\label{Para_1.11.6,,,"The description of the Papuan Malay \isi{phonology} in \chapref{Para_2} is based on a \isi{word list} of 1,117 lexical roots, extracted from the 2,458-item list. In addition, 380 items, \isi{historically derived} by (unproductive) \isi{affixation} of Malay roots, are investigated. The corpus also includes a large number of loanwords, originating from different donor languages, such as \ili{Arabic}, \ili{Chinese}, \ili{Dutch}, English, \ili{Persian}, \ili{Portuguese}, or \ili{Sanskrit}. Hence, a sizeable percentage of the attested lexical items are loanwords. So far, 719 items of the 2,458-item \isi{word list} (29%) have been identified as loanwords, using the following sources: \citet{Jones.2007} and \citet{Tadmor.2009} (on borrowing in Malay in general see also \citealt[151–156]{Blust.2013}). Upon further investigation, some of the 1,117 lexical roots listed as inherited Papuan Malay words may also turn out to be loanwords. In addition, the corpus includes a number of lexical items which are typically used in \ili{Standard Indonesian} but not in Papuan Malay; examples are Indonesian \textitbf{desa} ‘village’ and \textitbf{mereka} ‘\textsc{3pl}’ (the corresponding Papuan Malay words are \textitbf{kampung} ‘village’ and \textitbf{dorang}/\textitbf{dong} ‘\textsc{3pl}’, respectively). Given that these words are inherited Malay lexical items, they are not treated as loanwords in this book. However, neither are these items included in the \isi{word list} in Appendix \ref{Para_A}.",Para_A,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When the \isi{prepositional phrase} is moved to the front it denotes the temporal starting rather than the temporal endpoint of \textitbf{tidor} ‘sleep’, as in (\ref{Example_10.20}). Hence, the meaning changes to ‘come afternoon’ (literally ‘reaches the afternoon’). One initial explanation for this change in meaning is that the utterance in (\ref{Example_10.20}) expresses a sequence of two events, namely the \textitbf{sampe} ‘reaching’ of the afternoon and subsequently the \textitbf{tidor} ‘sleeping’. In that case, \textitbf{sampe sore} does not express the \isi{prepositional phrase} ‘until afternoon’ but the \isi{verbal clause} ‘reached the afternoon’ or ‘come afternoon’.

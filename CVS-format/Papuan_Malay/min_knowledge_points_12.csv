The analysis of the \textitbf{dua} ‘two’ as a \isi{numeral} predicate and not as an adnominal modifier is confirmed by the following fact. In the context of these utterances it is possible to insert existential \textitbf{ada} ‘exist’ between the subject \textitbf{ular} ‘snake’ and the predicate \textitbf{dua} ‘two’ which gives the emphatic progressive reading \textitbf{ular ada dua} ‘the snakes were being two’ or ‘the snakes were indeed two’ (see also §\ref{Para_5.4.1}). If \textitbf{ular dua} was a \isi{noun} phrase with the reading of ‘two snakes’, existential \textitbf{ada} ‘exist’ would have to precede or follow the \isi{noun} phrase such that \textitbf{ada ular dua} ‘there were two snakes’ or \textitbf{ular dua ada} ‘the two snakes exist’.

The clause \textitbf{situ alang-alang} ‘there (\textsc{emph}) (is only) cogongrass’ parallels the preceding clause \textitbf{sebla tida ada ruma} ‘on that side aren’t (any houses)’.

,,,,,"The main function of adnominal possessive constructions is to denote possession of a \isi{definite} possessum. In addition, \textitbf{punya} ‘\textsc{poss}’ serves other functions in ``\textsc{possr}{}-\textsc{np} – \textitbf{punya} ‘\textsc{poss}’ – \textsc{possm}{}-\textsc{np}'' constructions. It is employed to mark and emphasize \isi{locational}, temporal, or \isi{associative} relations, to indicate beneficiary relations, or to signal speaker attitudes and evaluations. Besides, the ligature is also used in reflexive expressions. (Possession of an \isi{indefinite} possessum is not expressed with an \isi{adnominal possessive construction}, but with a \isi{two-argument existential clause} or a nominal clause; details are presented in §\ref{Para_11.4.2} and §\ref{Para_12.2}, respectively.)",Para_11.4.2,Not found,Para_12.2,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In such clauses, the possessor is encoded by the grammatical subject (\textsc{s}) while the \isi{indefinite} possessum is the direct object (\textsc{o}) of the \isi{verb} (\textsc{v}) \textitbf{punya} ‘have’. This is illustrated in (\ref{Example_9.1}): the possessor \textitbf{sa} ‘1\textsc{sg}’ is the grammatical subject while the possessum \textitbf{rencana} ‘thought’ is the direct object of \textitbf{punya} ‘have’. Overall, however, verbal clauses with \textitbf{punya} ‘have’ are rather rare. Instead, speakers typically express possession of an \isi{indefinite} possessum with a \isi{two-argument existential clause} with \textitbf{ada} ‘exist’. This is demonstrated in (\ref{Example_9.2}): the possessor \textitbf{sa} ‘\textsc{1sg}’ is the subject while the \isi{indefinite} possessum \textitbf{ana} ‘child’ is the direct object of existential \textitbf{ada} ‘exist’.

As shown in (\ref{Example_9.3}), this type of possessive construction contrasts with the verbal constructions in (\ref{Example_9.1}) and (\ref{Example_9.2}): the possessive relation is not encoded by a two-argument clause but in a single construction which consists of two \isi{noun} phrases, which in turn functions as an argument in a clause.

Likewise, \textitbf{swara} ‘voice’ is not the direct object of a \isi{verbal clause}, but a \isi{definite} possessum.

,Noncanonical adnominal possessive constructions,\textitbf{punya ‘\textsc{poss’ in reflexive expressions,,,"The possessive marker \textitbf{punya} ‘\textsc{poss}’ is also used to create reflexive expressions. Generally speaking, reflexives designate constructions “where subject and object refer to the same entity, explicitly [{\ldots}] or implicitly” \citep[5164]{Asher.1994}. Typically, explicit reflexive expressions are formed with a reflexive \isi{pronoun} “which refers to the same person or thing as the subject of the \isi{verb}” \citep[5165]{Asher.1994}. As Papuan Malay does not have reflexive pronouns, an alternative strategy is used. Reflexive relations are expressed with an \isi{adnominal possessive construction} where a personal \isi{pronoun} in the possessor slot and the reflexive \isi{noun} \textitbf{diri} ‘self’ in the possessum slot express the reflexive relationship between both, as illustrated with \textitbf{sa pu diri} ‘myself’ in (\ref{Example_9.57}) and \textitbf{kita punya diri} ‘ourselves’ in (\ref{Example_9.58}).",Example_9.57,"\gll {bukang} {sa} {rasa} {bahwa} {sa} {ini} sa banggakang  \textbf{sa} \textbf{pu} \textbf{diri} tapi itu yang terjadi | \gls NEG 1SG feel that 1SG D.PROX 1SG praise 1SG POSS self but D.DIST REL happen | \glt ‘it’s not that I feel that I (EMPH), (that) I praise \textbf{myself}, but that’s what happened’ (Lit. ‘\textbf{the self of me}’)",Example_9.58,"\gll kita rencana, manusia yang mengatur \textbf{kita} \textbf{punya} \textbf{diri} | \gls 1PL plan human.being REL arrange 1PL POSS self | \glt ‘we make plans, (it’s us) human beings who manage \textbf{our own lives}’ (Lit. ‘\textbf{the self of us}’)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

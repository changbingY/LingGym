,Adverbs\label{sec:9,Manner adverbs\label{sec:9.2,,,"\textsc{manner} adverbs modify whole clauses by commenting on, for example, the manner in which a state comes across or in which an action is done. Manner adverbs usually come near or at the end of the clause they modify, as shown in example sentences \REF{ex:adv:1}-\REF{ex:adv:2} below. \tabref{tab:adv:manner} presents a sampling of these adverbs:",ex:adv:1,\gll Gaana mɛna=díí \textbf{zuku} \textbf{ʝ{\Í}k\ᶤ}. | \gls bad:3SG issues:NOM=those very completely | \glt ‘Those issues are really very bad!’,ex:adv:2,\gll Zízaaƙótùò ròɓà \textbf{m\`{ʉ}kà}. | \gls fat:DIST:COMP:3SG:SEQ people:NOM completely | \glt ‘And the people fattened up completely!’,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Adverbs\label{sec:9,Temporal adverbs\label{sec:9.3,Past \isi{tense adverbs (\textsc{pst)\label{sec:9.3.2,,"Ik divides \textsc{past tense} into four time periods and marks them with adverbial enclitics. They are: 1) \textsc{recent past} that covers the current day and is marked with =nákà, 2) \textsc{removed past} that covers yesterday (or any last or ‘yester-’ time period like 'yesterday' or 'yesteryear') and is marked with =bàtsè, 3) \textsc{remote past} that covers a few days or weeks before yesterday and is marked with =nótsò, and finally, 4) \textsc{remotest past} that covers everything before the remote past and is marked with =nòkò. Each of these \isi{tense} enclitics comes directly after ther verb and has a non-final and final form. \tabref{tab:adv:past} illustrates the Ik \isi{tense} markers in all their forms, and examples \REF{ex:adv:3}-\REF{ex:adv:4} illustrate their typical post-verbal position in a sentence:",ex:adv:3,\gll Ƙ{\'{a}á}=\textbf{bee} abáŋa sáás\`{ɔ}s{\Ì}n. | \gls go:3SG=PST2 my.father:NOM yesterday | \glt ‘My father went yesterday.’,ex:adv:4,\gll Maráŋa=\textbf{noo} ɦyekesa Icé. | \gls good:3SG=PST4 life:NOM Ik:GEN | \glt ‘The life of the Ik was good (back then).’,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike the simple past \isi{tense} adverbs, Ik past perfect \isi{tense} adverbs operate along only three periods of time: \textsc{recent} (earlier today), \textsc{removed} (yester-), and \textsc{remote} (before yester-). \tabref{tab:adv:prf} presents the Ik past perfect \isi{tense} adverbs, and example sentences \REF{ex:adv:5}-\REF{ex:adv:6} illustrate their use in natural contexts:",ex:adv:5,"\gll Náa atsíâdᵉ, ƙaa=\textbf{nanák\ᵃ}. | \gls when come:1SG:DP go:3SG=PST.PRF | \glt ‘When I came earlier, she had (already) gone.’",ex:adv:6,"\gll Tsʼ\'{ɛ}d\'{ɔ}\'{ɔ}=nɛ, tsʼéíƙotátà=\textbf{nànòk\ᵒ}. | \gls then:INS=DEM die.3PL:COMP=PST.PRF | \glt ‘By that (time), they had died out a while ago.’",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This sense of making a tentative inference based on an observation can be translated into English with such turns of phrase as ‘Apparently {\dots}’, ‘Maybe {\dots}’, ‘It seems that {\dots}’, ‘must have’, etc. Two of these inferential particles consist of the \isi{proclitic} ná plus a past-\isi{tense} \isi{particle}, while the third combines ná with the \isi{adverb} tsamʉ. \tabref{tab:adv:inf} presents the three inferential adverbial particles in their final and non-final forms. Note that compared to the past-\isi{tense} markers above in \tabref{tab:adv:past}, the inferential time-scale is moved up one notch more recent.

When used, these adverbs are placed before the verb, and the verb surfaces in its non-final form, almost like a question rendered in English ‘Why yes, did X not happen?’ – meaning that, of course, it did happen.

Doing so obviously disrupts the usual syntactic structure of main clauses. Two kinds of fronting are observed in the language: 1) a \textsc{cleft} construction and 2) \textsc{left-dislocation}. In a \isi{cleft construction}, the emphasized noun is moved to the front and given the \isi{copulative case}. This puts it in an identifying relationship with the original clause out of which it just came. As a result, the newly arranged clause can be viewed as a kind of \isi{copular} clause where the fronted element is the \isi{copular} subject and the original clause the \isi{copular} \isi{complement}. This can in turn be formulized as: [NP:\textsc{cop}]\textsc{\textsubscript{cs}}\textsc{ [clause]}\textsc{\textsubscript{cc}}. To make this more concrete, the next examples show the \isi{cleft construction} with a simple transitive clause in \REF{ex:syn:31} whose object (\textit{m\`{ɛ}s}) gets fronted and marked with the \isi{copulative case} in \REF{ex:syn:32}:\\",ex:syn:31,Not found,ex:syn:32,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We consider the two underlined na markers to be the \oldstylenums{3}\textsc{s} DO pronominal since even though there are multiple na{}-marked elements in the clause, these underlined markers are neither at the end of the noun phrase (as they would be if they were the definite marker), nor are they immediately before the final focussed element (as they would be if this was a presupposition-focus construction). The verb and noun phrases in question are each delimited by square brackets in the example. We found no unambiguous instance of the presupposition marker na breaking up a verb phrase except for the purpose of isolating the final focussed element in a verb phrase (cf. integrity of the \VP, \sectref{sec:8.1}). Thus the first underlined na is \oldstylenums{3}\textsc{s} \DO for the verb tozom ‘they eat.’ It is doubling the direct object noun phrase gəvax ‘field.' Likewise, we found no unambiguous instance of the presupposition marker breaking up a noun phrase in any context and so consider the second underlined na as \oldstylenums{3}\textsc{s} \DO pronominal for the nominalised verb məgəye ‘doing’ within the noun phrase məgəye na ahan ‘his doings.’",ex:11:53,"\gsrc Nde asa bahay a sla \textbf{na}, ndahan aka bay \textbf{na}, asa sla ahay \textbf{na}, | \gll ndɛ asa bahaj a ɬa \textbf{na} ndahaŋ aka baj \textbf{na} asa ɬa=ahaj \textbf{na} | \gls so if chief GEN cow PSP 3S on NEG PSP if cow=Pl PSP | \glt ‘So, if the owner of the cows wasn’t there, [and] that the cows’",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

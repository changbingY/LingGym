Example \REF{ex:12:61} is from the Race story \citep{Friesen2003}. The clause with macəkəmbay marks what the toad had done before the race -- he had secretly invited his brothers to line the race route so that there would always be a toad ahead of the giraffe. The giraffe ran faster than the toad, but when he stopped running and called out to see how far behind him the toad was, one of the toad’s friends ahead of him would call to him, making him run so hard that he collapsed, thereby losing the race.",ex:12:61,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Juxtaposed clauses\label{sec:12.4,,,,"Many clauses in a Moloko discourse are independent and are not linked grammatically to a preceding or following clause by a connector or by the presupposition marker na. The semantic nature of the connection between these unmarked, \nohyphens{juxtaposed} clauses is inferred from the context.\footnote{The presupposition marker na aids in making a connection between two clauses, because it makes it explicit that the first (na{}-marked) clause is known information. Na constructions have already been discussed in \sectref{sec:11.1}.} A juxtaposed clause can simply re-express the thought in the first clause. In \REF{ex:12:62}, the second clause restates in the negative that God is near. In \REF{ex:12:63}, the second clause makes more precise the general instruction in the first clause. In \REF{ex:12:64}, the second clause expands on what the speaker sees about the chief.

There are no conjunctions or discourse particles to indicate how the clauses are linked. These juxtaposed clauses are a fast-moving temporal sequence (with a narrator's interjection in S. 16): he takes his spear (S. 13), hears the penetration (S. 14--15), the snake falls (S. 17), he clubs it to death (S. 18).",ex:12:67,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

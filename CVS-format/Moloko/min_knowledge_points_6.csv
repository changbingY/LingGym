,The consonantal skeleton of the root\label{sec:6.2,,,,"The consonants in a verb stem in Moloko are remarkably constant. We have found only two irregular verbs where there are changes in the verb consonants. Firstly, the irregular verb /l\textsuperscript{o}/ adds an epenthetic [h] in some conjugations to break up vowels (the full conjugation of /l\textsuperscript{o}/ is in Appendix~\ref{sec:13.2}). Secondly, the root-final ɗ of the verb /z ɗ/ ‘take’ drops off when affixes and clitics are added (\ref{ex:6:1},~\ref{ex:6:2}). This process does not happen with the phonologically similar verb /f ɗ/ ‘put’ (\ref{ex:6:3},~\ref{ex:6:4}).",ex:6:1,Not found,ex:6:2,Not found,ex:6:3,Not found,ex:6:4,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Underlying suffix\label{sec:6.3,,,,"\citeyear{FriesenMamalis2008} found that although the /-j/ suffix appears to have no semantic value, it does allow certain consonants to be verb root final which would otherwise not be permitted.\footnote{I.e., [b, mb, d, nd, dz, nz, g, ŋg, gʷ, ŋgʷ, ts, w, j]. See discussion on word-final consonants in \sectref{sec:2.5.1}.} However, for many verb stems, it appears to be at least synchronically simply a place-holding suffix that drops off whenever other suffixes or extensions are attached to the verb (compare columns 3 and 4 in \tabref{tab:37}). Examples \REF{ex:6:5} and \REF{ex:6:6} show the same verb complex with \REF{ex:6:5} and without \REF{ex:6:6} the /-j/ suffix.\footnote{The first line in each example is the orthographic form. The second is the phonetic form (slow speech) with morpheme breaks.}",ex:6:5,\gsrc Apay. | \gll a-p-aj | \gls 3S-open-CL | \glt ‘It opens.’,ex:6:6,\gsrc Apala. | \gll a-p=ala | \gls 3S-open=to | \glt ‘It opens towards.’,ex:6:5,\gsrc Apay. | \gll a-p-aj | \gls 3S-open-CL | \glt ‘It opens.’,ex:6:6,\gsrc Apala. | \gll a-p=ala | \gls 3S-open=to | \glt ‘It opens towards.’,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Underlying suffix\label{sec:6.3,,,,"Because the suffix surfaces only word-finally, whenever the relevant verb is pronounced in isolation (and is thus phrase-final), the suffix syllable takes the phrase-final stress, necessitating a full vowel. It is therefore pronounced [aj] (see example \ref{ex:6:7}) in verbs with neutral prosody, [ɔj] in labialised verb stems, and [{}ɛ] in palatalised verb stems). Whenever the verb is not phrase-final, the vowel drops and an epenthetic schwa occurs, rendering the pronunciation [i] for labialised and neutral prosody verbs \REF{ex:6:8} and [ɪ] for palatalised verbs.",ex:6:7,Not found,ex:6:8,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Underlying vowel in the root\label{sec:6.4,,,,"\largerpage \citet{Bow1997c} noted that no Moloko verb root has more than one underlying internal vowel and many Moloko verb roots have no underlying vowels (see \tabref{tab:38}).\footnote{\citealt{Bow1997c}, page 24. Her database of 350 verb stems has 189 with the internal vowel.} The presence of an underlying internal vowel in the verb stem (if any) can be determined by studying the second plural imperative. Bow illustrates the following minimal pair. The verb stems /ts r/ ‘climb’ and /tsar/ ‘taste good’ have identical surface forms in the second person singular imperative (\ref{ex:6:9}--\ref{ex:6:10}) due to stress on the final syllable, which necessitates a full vowel. However, the presence of the underlying vowel can be seen in the second person plural imperative (\ref{ex:6:11}--\ref{ex:6:12}).\footnote{The {\twoP} imperative is formed by adding the suffix -om and labialisation prosody.} The verb root for ‘climb’ does not have an underlying vowel, so a schwa is inserted and labialised to become [ʊ] \REF{ex:6:11}. On the other hand, the verb root for ‘taste good’ has an internal vowel which becomes [ɔ] when labialised \REF{ex:6:12}.",ex:6:9,Not found,ex:6:10,Not found,ex:6:11,Not found,ex:6:12,Not found,ex:6:11,Not found,ex:6:12,Not found,,,,,,,,
,Underlying vowel in the root\label{sec:6.4,,,,"Bow discovered that when an underlying vowel exists in the root, it always immediately precedes the final root consonant, so possible verb roots could take the following forms (disregarding affixes): C, CC, CaC, CCC, CCaC, CCCaC.{ }These ‘full’ vowels will remain full in all inflections of the verb, and will be affected by the prosodies of the forms, resulting in surface [a, ɛ, ɔ, œ]. In syllables where there are no underlying vowels, an epenthetic schwa is inserted between certain consonant clusters to facilitate pronunciation in the inflected forms. On stressed syllables, the schwa will become its full vowel counterpart (see \ref{ex:6:9}).",ex:6:9,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Underlying prefix\label{sec:6.5,,,,"The verb stems in one class of bi-consonantal verbal stems take subject prefixes with the full vowel /a/ instead of the epenthetic schwa. \citet{Bow1997c} called this a historical a- prefix on the verb stem. She reported that 83 out of 231 bi-consonantal verb stems that she studied have the (now frozen) a- prefix. Whether a verb stem has this prefix or not can be determined from the nominalised form. Bow illustrates the presence of this prefix with the minimal pair /a-ndaw/ ‘swallow’ and /ndaw/ ‘insult.’ \REF{ex:6:13} and \REF{ex:6:14} show the nominalised form of the two verb stems.\footnote{The nominalised form has a \textit{mə{}-} or me- prefix, an \textit{{}-e} suffix, and is palatalised (\sectref{sec:7.6}).} The verb stem məndewe ‘swallow’ does not have the a- prefix. The verb stem mendewe ‘insult’ has the a- prefix (shown by the full vowel e in the prefix).",ex:6:13,\gsrc mənd\'{e}we | \gll mɪ-ndɛw-ɛ | \gls NOM-swallow-CL | \glt ‘swallowing’,ex:6:14,\gsrc mendewe | \gll mɛ-ndɛw-ɛ | \gls NOM-insult-CL | \glt ‘insulting’,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Palatalised verb stems may be high or low. The two possible tonal melodies are seen in the following minimal pair (from \citealt{FriesenMamalis2008}).

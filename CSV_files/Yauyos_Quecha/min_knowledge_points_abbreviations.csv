,,,,,"Throughout, \'A indicates alternation between \textipa{[\'a]} and an accent shift to the final syllable. H, I, N, R, and S indicate alternations between \textipa{[\o]} and \textipa{[h]}, \textipa{[i]}, \textipa{[n]}, \textipa{[r]}, and \textipa{[s]}, respectively. U indicates alternation between \textipa{[u]} and \textipa{[a]}. Y indicates alternation between \textipa{[y]}, \textipa{[i]} and \textipa{[\o]}. PI indicates an alternation between \textipa{[pi]} and \textipa{[\o]} (unique to the additive enclitic \phono{-pis}). The first five alternations are conditioned by environment in all dialects. R indicates alternative realizations of \textipa{*/r/} -- realized as \textipa{[r]} in all dialects except that of \CH{}, where it is predominantly realized as \textipa{[l]}. Where two morphemes share the same code (as occurs, for example in the case of \mbox{-pa} and \mbox{-pi}, which both indicate both genitive and locative case) the code is subscripted with a number~(i.e., \textsc{gen}\tss{1}, \textsc{gen}\tss{2}; \textsc{loc}\tss{1}, \textsc{loc}\tss{2}). Where the same morpheme has two or more functions~(as is the case, for example, with \phono{-paq}, which indicates ablative, benefactive and purposive cases) the morpheme is subscripted~(i.e., \phono{-paq\tss{1}}, \phono{-paq\tss{2}}, \phono{-paq\tss{3}}). In the body of the text, I do not make use of thse subscripts. Unless otherwise noted, a morpheme occurs in all five dialects. Where a morpheme is exclusive to one or more dialects, that is indicated in small caps in parentheses. Tables~\ref{Tab3} and~\ref{Tab4} list morpheme codes and their corresponding morphemes. The former is sorted by morpheme code; the latter, by morpheme.",Tab3,Not found,Tab4,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Further analysis of evidential modifiers,The EM’s and the interpretation of propositions under direct \phono{-mI,,,,"In the case of the direct \phono{-mI}, all three forms, \phono{-mI-\uo}, \phono{-m-ik}, and \phono{m-iki}, indicate that the speaker has evidence from personal experience for the proposition immediately under the scope of the evidential. The \phono{-ik} and \phono{-iki} forms then indicate increases in the strength of that evidence, generally that it is increasingly immediate or definitive. For example, consultants explain, with \phono{wañu-rqa-\uo} [die-\lsc{pst}-3] ‘died’, a speaker might use \phono{-mI-\uo} if she had seen the corpse, while she would use \phono{-m-iki} if she had actually been present when the person died. Or with \phono{para-ya-n} [rain-\lsc{prog}-3] ‘it’s raining’, a speaker might use \phono{-mI-\uo} if she were observing the rain from inside through a window, while she would use \phono{-m-iki} if she were actually standing under the rain. (\ref{GloB:Ariya}) and~(\ref{GloB:Huk}) give naturally-occurring \phono{-m-iki} examples. In~(\ref{GloB:Ariya}) the speaker reports her girlhood experience working as a shepherdess in the \phono{puna} (high, cold, wet pasture grounds). What would run out on her was her matches. In~(\ref{GloB:Huk}) the speaker reports her experience with the Shining Path\index[sub]{Shining Path}, an armed Maoist group that terrorized the region in the 1980’s with its robberies, kidnappings and public executions. The fight she refers to is the battle between the Shining Path and the government Sinchis (commandos). In both examples, the speakers are reporting events they experienced with painful immediacy and with regard to which there are no more authoritative sources than themselves.\\",GloB:Ariya,"\gsrc Ariyá urqupaqa puchukapakunchik\textbf{miki}. | \gll ari-yá urqu-pa-qa puchuka-paku-nchik-m-iki | \gls yes-EMPH hill-LOC-TOP finish-MUTBEN-1PL-EVD-IKI | \glt Yes, in the hills \textbf{we ran out}.",GloB:Huk,\gsrc Huk visislla piliyara chaypaq chinkakuraña\textbf{miki}. | \gll huk visis-lla piliya-ra chay-paq chinka-ku-ra-ña-m-iki | \gls one times-RSTR fight-PST DEM.D-ABL lose-REFL-PST-DISC-EVD-IKI | \glt They fought just once and then \textbf{they disappeared}.,GloB:Ariya,"\gsrc Ariyá urqupaqa puchukapakunchik\textbf{miki}. | \gll ari-yá urqu-pa-qa puchuka-paku-nchik-m-iki | \gls yes-EMPH hill-LOC-TOP finish-MUTBEN-1PL-EVD-IKI | \glt Yes, in the hills \textbf{we ran out}.",GloB:Huk,\gsrc Huk visislla piliyara chaypaq chinkakuraña\textbf{miki}. | \gll huk visis-lla piliya-ra chay-paq chinka-ku-ra-ña-m-iki | \gls one times-RSTR fight-PST DEM.D-ABL lose-REFL-PST-DISC-EVD-IKI | \glt They fought just once and then \textbf{they disappeared}.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Further analysis of evidential modifiers,The EM’s and the interpretation of propositions under direct \phono{-mI,,,,"In addition to indicating increases in evidence strength, \phono{-ik} and \phono{-iki}, in combination with \phono{-mI}, generally correspond to increases in strength of assertion. A \phono{-m-ik} assertion is interpreted as stronger than a \phono{-mI-\uo} assertion; a \phono{-m-iki} assertion as stronger still. In Spanish, \phono{-mI-\uo} generally has no reflex in translation. More than anything else, it serves to mark comment or focus (see \sectref{sec:emphasis}) or else to stand in for the copular verb \phono{ka}, defective in the third-person present tense (see \sectref{ssec:copu}). In contrast, \phono{-m-iki} does have a reflex in Spanish: it translates with an emphatic, either \spanish{pues} ‘then’ or \spanish{sí} ‘yes’. So, \phono{quni-\pb{m-}\pb{\uo}} [warm-\lsc{evd}-\uo{}] receives the Spanish translation ‘\spanish{es caliente}’ ‘it’s warm’; in contrast, \phono{quni-\pb{m-iki}} [warm-\lsc{evd}-\lsc{ki}] receives the translations, ‘\spanish{es caliente, pues}’ ‘it’s warm, then’ or‘\spanish{sí, es caliente} ‘yes, it’s warm’. Example~(\ref{GloB:Kananqa}) is taken from a story. An old lady has sent two boys for wood --~“so I can cook you a nice supper,” she said. Two doves appear at the wood pile to warn the boys. \phono{Miku-shunki\pb{-m-iki}} ‘she’s going to eat you’, they warn. Using the \phono{-iki} form, the birds make the strongest assertion they can. They need to convince the boys that they are indeed in trouble --~their very lives are in danger.\\",GloB:Kananqa,\gsrc Kananqa wirayaykachishunki mikushunki\textbf{miki}. | \gll kanan-qa wira-ya-yka-chi-shunki miku-shunki-mi-ki}. | \gls now-TOP fat-INCH-EXCEP-CAUS-3>2.FUT eat-3>2.FUT-EVD-IKI | \glt Now she’s going to fatten you up and \textbf{eat you}!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Further analysis of evidential modifiers,The EM’s and the interpretation of propositions under direct \phono{-mI,,,,"In those cases in which \phono{-mI} takes scope over universal-deontic-modal or future-tense verbs, \phono{-k} and \phono{-ki} do not generally indicate an increase in evidence strength; rather, they indicate increasingly strong obligations and increasingly immediate futures, respectively. So, for example, under the scope of \phono{-mI-\uo}, \phono{yanapa-na-y} [help-\lsc{nmlz}-1] receives a weak universal deontic interpretation, ‘I ought to help’. In contrast, under the scope of \phono{-m-ik} or \phono{-m-iki}, the same phrase receives increasingly strong universal interpretations, on the order of ‘I have to help’ and ‘I must help’, respectively. Under the scope of \phono{-mI-\uo}, the phrase is understood as something like a strong suggestion, while under \phono{-m-iki}, it is understood as a more urgent obligation. That is, here, \phono{-ik} and \phono{-iki} seem to do something like increase the degree of modal force, turning a weak universal modal into a strong one. This is the case, too, where \phono{-mI} takes scope over future-tense verbs. For example, explain consultants, in the case of the future-tense \phono{ri-shaq} [go-1.\lsc{fut}] ‘I will go’, a speaker might use\phono{-mI-\uo} if she were going to go at some unspecified, possibly very distant future time. In contrast, she might use \phono{-m-ik} if her going were imminent, and \phono{-m-iki} if she were already on her way. The speaker of~(\ref{GloB:yakuta}), for example, urgently needed to water her garden and had been on her way to do just that when she got caught up in the conversation. When she uttered~(\ref{GloB:yakuta}) she was, in fact, already in motion.\\",GloB:yakuta,\gsrc Ri\textbf{shaq} yakuta\textbf{miki} qawa\textbf{shaq}. | \gll ri-shaq yaku-ta-mi-ki qawa-mu-shaq | \gls go-1.FUT water-ACC-EVD-IKI look-CISL-1.FUT | \glt I’m \textbf{going to} go.

Further analysis of evidential modifiers,The EM’s and the interpretation of propositions under conjectural \phono{-trI,,,,"Present-tense conditional verbs in \SYQ{} may receive at least existential ability, circumstantial, deontic, epistemic and teleological interpretations. Past-tense conditional verbs may, in addition to these, also receive universal deontic and epistemic interpretations. That is, present-tense conditionals are specified for modal force [existential], but not modal base, while past-tense conditionals are specified for neither force nor base. \phono{-trI} restricts the interpretation of conditionals, generally excluding all but epistemic readings. In the case of past-tense conditionals, it generally excludes all but universal readings, as well. For example, although the present-tense conditional of~(\ref{GloB:Qalapis}), \phono{saya-ru-chuwan} ‘we could stand around’, is normally five-ways ambiguous, under the scope of \phono{-trI}, only the existential epistemic reading available: ‘it could happen that we stand around’. Similarly, although the past-tense conditional of~(\ref{GloB:mikuramanman}), \phono{miku-ra-ma-n-man} \phono{ka-rqa-\uo} ‘could/would/should/might have eaten me’, is normally seven-ways ambiguous, under the scope of \phono{-trI}, only the universal epistemic reading is available: ‘the Devil would necessarily have eaten me’. The context for~(\ref{GloB:Qalapis}) --~a discussion of women and alcohol~-- supports the epistemic reading. The speaker, a woman who in her eighty-odd years had never taken alcohol, was speculating on what would happen if women were to drink. Her conclusion: it’s possible we would stand around naked, going crazy.\\",GloB:Qalapis,"\gsrc Qalapis sayaruchuwan-\textbf{tri} lukuyarishpaqa. | \gll qala-pis saya-ru-chuwan-tri luku-ya-ri-shpa-qa | \gls naked-ADD stand-URGT-1PL.COND-EVC crazy-INCH-INCEP-SUBIS-TOP | \glt We could also stand around naked, going crazy.",GloB:mikuramanman,Not found,GloB:Qalapis,"\gsrc Qalapis sayaruchuwan-\textbf{tri} lukuyarishpaqa. | \gll qala-pis saya-ru-chuwan-tri luku-ya-ri-shpa-qa | \gls naked-ADD stand-URGT-1PL.COND-EVC crazy-INCH-INCEP-SUBIS-TOP | \glt We could also stand around naked, going crazy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Further analysis of evidential modifiers,The EM’s and the interpretation of propositions under conjectural \phono{-trI,,,,"If it is the case, as \citet{Copley09} argue,\index[aut]{Copley, Bridget} and \citet{Matthewson05}\index[aut]{Matthewson, Lisa}\index[aut]{Rullmann, Hotze}\index[aut]{Davis, Henry} that the future tense is a modal specified for both force, [universal], and base, [metaphysical] or [circumstantial], \phono{-trI} should have no effect on the interpretation of mode in the case of future-tense verbs. This is indeed the case. For example, both the \phono{tiya-pa-ru-wa-nga} of~(\ref{GloB:Kukachankunata}) and \phono{ashna-ku-lla-shaq} of~(\ref{GloB:Ashnakullashaq}) receive exactly the interpretations they would have were they not under the scope of \phono{-trI:} ‘they will accompany me sitting’ and ‘I’m going to stink’, respectively. This does not mean that \phono{-trI-\uo/ik/iki} has no effect on the interpretation of future-tense verbs, however. Although it leaves \lsc{tam} interpretation unaffected, \phono{-trI} continues to indicate that the proposition under its scope is a conjecture. And \phono{-ik} and \phono{-iki}, as they do in conjunction with \phono{-mI}, indicate increasingly immediate or certain futures. So, although the \lsc{tam} interpretations of~(\ref{GloB:Kukachankunata})’s \phono{tiya-pa-ru-wa-nga} ‘will accompany me sitting’ and~(\ref{GloB:Ashnakullashaq})’s \phono{ashna-ku-lla-shaq} ‘I’m going to stink’ are unchanged under the scope of \phono{-trI}, the \phono{-ik} of the first and the \phono{-iki} of the second signal immediate and certain futures, respectively. In~(\ref{GloB:Kukachankunata}), that future was about an hour away: it was 6 o’clock and the those who were to accompany the speaker were expected at 7:00 for a healing ceremony. The context for~(\ref{GloB:Ashnakullashaq}), too, was a healing ceremony. The speaker was referring to the upcoming part of the ceremony in which she would have to wash with putrid urine --~certain to make anyone stink!\\",GloB:Kukachankunata,"\gsrc Kukachankunata aparuptiyqa tiyaparuwanqa\textbf{trik}. | \gll kuka-cha-n-kuna-ta apa-ru-pti-y-qa tiya-pa-ru-wa-nqa-tri-k | \gls coca-DIM-3-PL-ACC bring-URGT-SUBDS-1-TOP sit-BEN-URGT-1.OBJ-3.FUT-EVC-IK | \glt When I bring them their coca, \textbf{they will accompany me sitting}.",GloB:Ashnakullashaq,\gsrc ¡Ashnakullashaq\textbf{triki}! | \gll ashna-ku-lla-shaq-tri-ki | \gls smell-REFL-RSTR-1.FUT-EVC-IKI | \glt \textbf{I’m going to stink}!,GloB:Kukachankunata,"\gsrc Kukachankunata aparuptiyqa tiyaparuwanqa\textbf{trik}. | \gll kuka-cha-n-kuna-ta apa-ru-pti-y-qa tiya-pa-ru-wa-nqa-tri-k | \gls coca-DIM-3-PL-ACC bring-URGT-SUBDS-1-TOP sit-BEN-URGT-1.OBJ-3.FUT-EVC-IK | \glt When I bring them their coca, \textbf{they will accompany me sitting}.",GloB:Ashnakullashaq,\gsrc ¡Ashnakullashaq\textbf{triki}! | \gll ashna-ku-lla-shaq-tri-ki | \gls smell-REFL-RSTR-1.FUT-EVC-IKI | \glt \textbf{I’m going to stink}!,GloB:Kukachankunata,"\gsrc Kukachankunata aparuptiyqa tiyaparuwanqa\textbf{trik}. | \gll kuka-cha-n-kuna-ta apa-ru-pti-y-qa tiya-pa-ru-wa-nqa-tri-k | \gls coca-DIM-3-PL-ACC bring-URGT-SUBDS-1-TOP sit-BEN-URGT-1.OBJ-3.FUT-EVC-IK | \glt When I bring them their coca, \textbf{they will accompany me sitting}.",GloB:Ashnakullashaq,\gsrc ¡Ashnakullashaq\textbf{triki}! | \gll ashna-ku-lla-shaq-tri-ki | \gls smell-REFL-RSTR-1.FUT-EVC-IKI | \glt \textbf{I’m going to stink}!,,,,,,,,
Further analysis of evidential modifiers,The EM’s and the interpretation of propositions under conjectural \phono{-trI,,,,"In those cases in which \phono{-ik} and \phono{-iki} modify \phono{-trI}, they generally correspond to increases in certainty of conjecture: a \phono{-tr-ik} conjecture is interpreted as more certain than a \phono{-trI\uo} conjecture; and a \phono{-tr-iki} conjecture is interpreted as more certain still. Recall that under the scope of \phono{-trI}, present-tense conditional verbs generally receive existential epistemic interpretations while past-tense-conditional as well as simple-present- and simple-past-tense verbs generally receive universal epistemic interpretations. In the case of the first, \phono{-k} and \phono{-ki} yield increasingly strong possibility readings; in the case of the second, third and fourth, increasingly strong necessity readings. So, under the scope of \phono{trI-\uo}, the present-tense conditional \phono{wañu-ru-n-man} [die-\lsc{urgt}-3-\lsc{cond}] ‘could die’ receives something like a weak possibility reading; under \phono{-tr-iki}, in contrast, the same phrase receives something like a strong possibility reading. Consultants explain that the \phono{-\uo} form might be used in a situation where the person was sick but it remained to be seen whether he would die; the \phono{-iki} form, in contrast, might be used in a situation where the person was gravely ill and far more likely to die. Similarly, under the scope of \phono{-trI-\uo}, the simple past tense \phono{wañu-rqa-\uo} [die-\lsc{pst}-3] ‘died’ would receive something like a weak necessity reading: it is highly probable but not completely certain that the person died. In contrast, under the scope of \phono{-tr-iki}, the same phrase would receive something like a strong necessity reading: it is very highly probable, indeed, virtually certain, that the person died. Consultants explain that a speaker might use \phono{-\uo} form if she knew, say, that the person, who had been very sick, still had not returned two months after having been transported down the mountain to a hospital in Lima. In contrast, that same speaker might use the \phono{-iki} form if she had, additionally, say, heard funeral bells ringing and seen two of person’s daughters crying in the church. (\ref{GloB:Almayuqpis}) and~(\ref{GloB:Anuyanna}) give naturally-occurring examples. In~(\ref{GloB:Almayuqpis}), the speaker\tss{i} makes a present-tense conditional \phono{-trI-\uo} conjecture: She\tss{j} could possibly be with a soul (\ie,~accompanied by the spirit of a recently deceased relative). The speaker made this conjecture after hearing the report of a single piece of evidence --~that a calf had spooked when she\tss{j} came near. Surely, whether or not a person is walking around with the spirit of a recently dead relative hovering somewhere close by is a hard thing to judge, even with an accumulation of evidence. In this case, only the weak \phono{-\uo} form is licensed. In~(\ref{GloB:Anuyanna}), in contrast, the speaker makes a simple-present-tense \phono{-tr-iki} conjecture: A certain calf (a friend’s) must be being weaned. The speaker, having spent all but a half dozen of her 70-odd years raising goats, sheep, cows and alpacas, would not just be making an educated guess as to whether a calf was being weaned. She knows the signs. In this situation, the strong \phono{-iki} form is licensed.\\",GloB:Almayuqpis,\gsrc Almayuqpis kayanman\textbf{tri}. | \gll alma-yuq-pis ka-ya-n-man-tri | \gls soul-POSS-ADD be-PROG-3-COND-EVC | \glt She \textbf{might be} accompanied by a soul.,GloB:Anuyanna,"\gsrc Anuyanña\textbf{triki}. | \gll anu-ya-n-ña-tr-iki | \gls wean-PROG-3-DISC-EVD-IKI | \glt She \textbf{must} be weaning him already, for sure.",GloB:Almayuqpis,\gsrc Almayuqpis kayanman\textbf{tri}. | \gll alma-yuq-pis ka-ya-n-man-tri | \gls soul-POSS-ADD be-PROG-3-COND-EVC | \glt She \textbf{might be} accompanied by a soul.,GloB:Anuyanna,"\gsrc Anuyanña\textbf{triki}. | \gll anu-ya-n-ña-tr-iki | \gls wean-PROG-3-DISC-EVD-IKI | \glt She \textbf{must} be weaning him already, for sure.",,,,,,,,,,,,

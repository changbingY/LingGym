,Phonological structure of the noun stem\label{sec:4.1,,,,"\citet{Bow1997c} studied syllable patterns in nouns. \tabref{tab:4.24} (from \citealt{Bow1997c}) shows examples of one- to three-syllable noun words of each possible syllable pattern, with and without labialisation and palatalisation prosodies. Syllable pattern is independent of prosody. Bow found many nouns that are CVC but very few that are CV. However, many CVCV nouns actually contain a reduplicated syllable, (\ref{ex:4:13}--\ref{ex:4:15}).",ex:4:13,Not found,ex:4:15,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Morphological structure of the noun word\label{sec:4.2,,,,"\largerpage A noun stem can consist of a simple noun root \REF{ex:4:16} or two reduplicated segments \REF{ex:4:17}. These reduplicated elements actually form two separate phonological words (note the word-final alteration ŋ in both segments) but are lexically one item.\footnote{Because there are word-final consonant changes for only /n/ and /h/, it is not known whether all similar reduplications necessarily form two separate phonological words.}",ex:4:16,Not found,ex:4:17,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Morphological structure of the noun word\label{sec:4.2,,,,"Nouns can be derived from verbs\is{Derivational processes!Verb to noun} by a potentially complex process where a prefix, a suffix, and palatalisation are added. The prefix is mə- or me-, depending on whether the verb has the /a-/ prefix or not. The suffix is -əye or -e, depending on whether the verb root has one or more consonants. The suffix carries palatalisation which palatalises the whole word. The resulting form is an abstract noun which cannot take the plural =ahay but which otherwise has all the characteristics of a noun. This highly productive process is discussed further in \sectref{sec:7.6} but two nominalisations are shown here. In \REF{ex:4:18} and \REF{ex:4:19}, the underlying form, the {\twoS} imperative, and the nominalised form are given. A one-syllable verb with no prefix takes the prefix mə- and the suffix \textit{{}-əye} \REF{ex:4:18}.

The plural clitic carries some features of a separate phonological word and some of a phonologically bound morpheme.

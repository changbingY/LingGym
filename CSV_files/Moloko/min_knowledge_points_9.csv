,Two kinds of transitive clauses\label{sec:9.1,,,,"Moloko has two kinds of transitive clauses -- transitive clauses with subject and direct object (\ref{ex:9:1}--\ref{ex:9:2}) and transitive clauses with subject and indirect object (\ref{ex:9:3}--\ref{ex:9:4}). These two grammatically different transitive clauses illustrate that the semantics of Moloko verbs allows three core participants (represented by subject, direct object, and indirect object). Moloko verbs do not have just Agent-Patient semantic frames for events. In this work we follow an Agent-Theme-Location analysis, as developed by \citet{DeLancey1991}, in which ‘Location’ (\LOC) has a particular definition. Indirect object always expresses semantic {\LOC} -- the participant that represents the place where the Theme is directed to. As such the indirect object can express (depending on the verb type, see Sections~\ref{sec:9.2.3}--\ref{sec:9.2.5}) the recipient or beneficiary of the event. Direct object always expresses semantic Theme, the core participant that changes position or state because of the event.

This is a case of noun incorporation where these body-part nouns are closely associated with the verb complex and their incorporation changes the lexical characteristics of the verb. These body-part nouns include ma ‘mouth,’ (\ref{ex:9:45}, \sectref{sec:9.3.1.3}), elé ‘eye,’ (\ref{ex:9:46}, \sectref{sec:9.3.1.1}), sləmay ‘ear,’ (\ref{ex:9:47}, \sectref{sec:9.3.1.2}), and va or har ‘body,’ (\ref{ex:9:48}, \ref{ex:9:49}, Sections~\ref{sec:9.3.1.4} and \ref{sec:9.3.1.5}, respectively). These nouns can be incorporated into transitive or bitransitive verbs from the types in Sections~\ref{sec:9.2.2} and \ref{sec:9.2.3}.",ex:9:45,\gsrc Ataraŋ aka \textbf{ma} ana war ese. | \gll a-tar=aŋ =aka \textbf{ma} ana war ɛʃɛ | \gls 3S-call=3S.IO =on mouth DAT child again | \glt ‘He/she calls the child again.’ (lit. he calls mouth to him to the child again),ex:9:46,\gsrc Mala amənjar \textbf{elé.} | \gll Mala a-mənzar \textbf{ɛlɛ} | \gls Mala 3S-see eye | \glt ‘Mala looks around attentively.’,ex:9:47,\gsrc Acaka va \textbf{sləmay} ana mama ahan bay. | \gll a-ts=aka=va \textbf{ɬəmaj} ana mama=ahaŋ baj | \gls 3S-hear=on=PRF ear DAT mother=3S.POSS NEG | \glt ‘He/she is disobedient to his mother.’ (he disobeys his mother)\footnote{Note that the word-final /n/ is deleted on the root /ts n\textsuperscript{e}/when the verbal extension is attached \sectref{sec:2.6.1}.},ex:9:48,\gsrc Tandalay talala təzləge \textbf{va} ana Məloko ahay. | \gll ta-ndalaj ta-l=ala tɪ-ɮɪg-ɛ \textbf{va} ana Mʊlɔkʷɔ=ahaj | \gls 3P-PRG 3P-go=to 3P-throw-CL body DAT Moloko=Pl | \glt ‘They were coming and fighting with the Molokos.’ (lit. they were coming they threw body to Molokos),ex:9:49,\gsrc Ma ango agəsaw \textbf{har}. | \gll ma=aŋgʷɔ a-gəs=aw \textbf{har} | \gls word=twoS.POSS 3S-catch=oneS.IO body | \glt ‘It pleases me.’ (lit. it catches body to me),,,,,,,,,,
,“Body-part” verbs (noun incorporation)\label{sec:9.3\is{Noun incorporation|(,,,,"The body-part noun follows directly after all other elements in the verb complex. It appears to be in the same position as any other noun phrase direct object in the verb phrase (see \chapref{chap:8}); however it is in more tightly bound to the verb complex than a noun phrase. The body-part noun does not fill the \DO pronominal slot, because verbal extensions that follow the \DO pronominal in the Moloko verb complex precede the body-part (see \ref{ex:9:45} and \ref{ex:9:47} which each have an adpositional extension, see \sectref{sec:7.5.1}). It is not phonologically bound to the verb since, unlike the Perfect verbal extension =va which is part of the verb complex, the body-part va does not neutralise the prosody on the verb stem \REF{ex:9:48}. However, the incorporated noun is grammatically closer to the verb complex than a noun phrase direct object would be because the body-part can never be separated from the verb complex. The body-part can never be fronted in the clause (see \sectref{sec:8.1}). Nor can the body-part be separated from the verb complex by the presupposition marker.

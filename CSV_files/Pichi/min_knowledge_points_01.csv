Introduction,Affiliation\label{sec:1.4,,,,"Within the African AECs, Pichi is most directly related to the \ili{Krio} language of Sierra Leone. A comparison of the two languages yields systematic lexical and structural correspondences. But it also reveals some differences. To begin with, both languages share a large percentage of non-basic vocabulary\is{basic vocabulary}, as shown in (\ref{ex:1:7}a), with the same tonal configurations. However, the Yoruba (b), Mende (c), and Temne (d) component of the Pichi lexicon appears to be much smaller than that of Krio and is limited to a few words in the corpus (data from \citealt{FyleJones1980}):",ex:1:7,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Introduction,Affiliation\label{sec:1.4,,,,"The two languages also share a number of lexical items common to numerous African and American English-lexicon Creoles. These were first compiled by (\citealt{Smith1987,Smith2001,Smith2015}) and termed “Ingredient X, Y, and Z”. In \REF{ex:1:8}, I list all the relevant words contained in the Pichi corpus. They comprise “Ingredient X” words of African origin (a), “Ingredient Y” words of Portuguese origin (b), “Ingredient Z” words of English origin (c), as well as a few function words of diverse origin (d):",ex:1:8,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Introduction,Affiliation\label{sec:1.4,,,,"Some of the differences in vocabulary between the two languages owe to the same phonological characteristics that differentiate the members of Group 1 (Pichi) and Group 2 (\ili{Krio}) in the preceding section. Hence, most speakers of Pichi make no phonemic distinction between alveolar and postalveolar fricatives (\ref{ex:1:9}a); the phonemic distinction between close-mid and open-mid vowels is neutralised by most speakers (b).",ex:1:9,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Introduction,Affiliation\label{sec:1.4,,,,"The role of the respective superstrates \ili{English} (for \ili{Krio}) and \ili{Spanish} (for Pichi) can be read from the impact of these two languages on institutional and administrative terminology (\ref{ex:1:10}a), the numeral system above ten (b), and other lexical items (c). The use of a larger number of English-derived lexical items in \ili{Krio} corresponds with a stronger presence of Spanish-derived lexicon in Pichi:",ex:1:10,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Introduction,Affiliation\label{sec:1.4,,,,"There is a high degree of correspondence between the forms of Pichi and \ili{Krio} function words and the categories they express. For example, the forms and functions of the TMA\is{tense}\is{modality}\is{aspect} markers in \REF{ex:1:11} are largely coterminous:",ex:1:11,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Introduction,Affiliation\label{sec:1.4,,,,"However, the distribution of the markers in \REF{ex:1:11} is not always identical in the two languages. For example, the \ili{Krio} data reveals more combinatorial possibilities of the habitual\is{habitual aspect} marker kin ‘\textsc{hab}’ with other TMA markers (cf. \citealt{Dandeson2001}), while the Pichi imperfective marker \is{imperfective aspect} de ‘\textsc{ipfv}’ seems to have a broader range of functions than the \ili{Krio} cognate form. Moreover, \ili{Krio} has at least two auxiliary constructions which are not attested in my data. The verb blánt is only employed as a lexical verb with the meaning ‘reside’ in Pichi. In \ili{Krio}, the element blant is a preverbal TMA element that expresses habitual aspect. Further evidence for grammaticalisation is that blant is L-toned in this function. Consider the following example (Krio sentences are marked \textsc{Krio}):",ex:1:11,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Introduction,Affiliation\label{sec:1.4,,,,"Further, \ili{Krio} employs the locative-existential copula dé \textsc{‘be.loc’} together with the preposition pan ‘on’ in an, albeit lectally restricted, auxiliary construction to express \isi{progressive aspect} \REF{ex:1:13}. The construction is rejected by Pichi speakers \REF{ex:1:14}:",ex:1:13,Not found,ex:1:14,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Introduction,Affiliation\label{sec:1.4,,,,"Conversely, there is no data to suggest the existence in \ili{Krio} of the Pichi egressive aspect construction involving the auxiliary verb kɔmɔ́t ‘go/come out’ \REF{ex:1:15} or, obviously, the continuative aspect construction featuring the Spanish-derived verb sigue ‘continue’ \REF{ex:1:16}. Equally, an adverbial SVC involving the V1 sté ‘stay, be a long time’ appears to be unique to Pichi \REF{ex:1:17}:",ex:1:15,Not found,ex:1:16,\gll A \textbf{sigue} \textbf{plé} bɔ́l sóté ívin tɛ́n. | \gls 1SG.SBJ continue play ball until evening time | \glt ‘I continued playing ball until the evening.’,ex:1:17,\gll A \textbf{sté} \textbf{chɔ́p}. | \gls 1SG.SBJ stay eat | \glt ‘It’s been a long time since I ate.’,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Introduction,Affiliation\label{sec:1.4,,,,"The literature on \ili{Krio} also indicates a wider range and a more pervasive use of SVCs than attested for Pichi. For instance, \ili{Krio} has a resultative SVC \is{resultative SVC}featuring dynamic verbs in the V2 position \REF{ex:1:18} and a \textsc{give}{}-type SVC in order to mark a recpient or beneficiary \REF{ex:1:19}. Both types of construction are not attested in Pichi:",ex:1:18,Not found,ex:1:19,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Introduction,Affiliation\label{sec:1.4,,,,"In contrast, resultative state of affairs similar to \REF{ex:1:18} above may only feature stative property items as secondary verbs. Such constructions in Pichi are best seen to involve secondary predication \REF{ex:1:20}:",ex:1:18,Not found,ex:1:20,\gll Dɛn dɔ́n \textbf{bíl} di hós \textbf{strɔ́n}. | \gls 3PL PFV build DEF road be.strong | \glt ‘The house is solidly built.’,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Introduction,Affiliation\label{sec:1.4,,,,"At the same time, Pichi only employs a less integrated type of multiverb construction, namely clause chaining, in order to express a sentence like \REF{ex:1:19}, involving a dynamic V2. Note that unlike the \ili{Krio} sentences above, the Pichi example in \REF{ex:1:21} exhibits resumptive\is{resumptive pronouns} subject marking, i.e. the subject is repeated with the second verb in the series:",ex:1:19,Not found,ex:1:21,\gll \textbf{Yu} \textbf{ték} di mɔní \textbf{yu} \textbf{gí} mí. | \gls 2SG take DEF money 2SG give 1SG.INDP | \glt ‘You took the money (and) gave it to me.’,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the expression of plural number does not lie within the functional range of repetition. In the following three examples, we witness the use of intensifying repetition for emphasis with the temporal adverb náw ‘now’ \REF{ex:key:146}, the locative noun dɔ́n ‘down’ \REF{ex:key:147}, the common noun fámbul ‘family’, and the attributively used property item bɔkú ‘(be) much’ \REF{ex:key:148}:",ex:key:146,\gll A de kɔmɔ́t na tɔ́n \textbf{náw} \textbf{náw}. | \gls 1SG.SBJ IPFV come.out LOC town now REP | \glt ‘I coming from town right now.’,ex:key:147,\gll Bɔt ín sidɔ́n \textbf{dɔ́n} \textbf{dɔ́n} \textbf{dɔ́n} yandá. | \gls but 3SG.INDP stay down REP REP yonder | \glt ‘But he stays far down over there.’,ex:key:148,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sentence \REF{ex:key:150} features the threefold repetition of the Spanish numeral quinientos ‘five hundred’.

Morphology,Iteration\label{sec:4.5,Repetition,,,"The preceding examples have shown that various syntactic categories may be subjected to repetition.

The corpus contains numerous instances of repeated time expressions with an emphatic, quantificational meaning.

Expressions like ívin tɛ́n ‘evening’ or sán tɛ́n ‘noon’ do not appear to lend themselves to some concept of quantification or gradation. This is possibly so because the corresponding period is of no cultural relevance, while ‘at dawn’ in \REF{ex:key:151} above is, since this is when people usually get up.

Sentence \REF{ex:key:159} exemplifies the partial iteration of lílí ‘(be) little’. A simplex word *lí does not exist in Pichi.

The presence of tone deletion points to the operation of partial reduplication rather than repetition. This contrasts with the iteration of other, attributively used property items in a similar way. In \REF{ex:key:155} and \REF{ex:key:156} above, bíg and smɔ́l undergo repetition, not reduplication.

Morphology,Iteration\label{sec:4.5,Repetition,,,There is often no sharp distinction in meaning between the repetition of single words and the iteration of larger chunks of a sentence. This is particularly so if the repeated elements are not separated from each other by a pause or declarative intonation (hence an utterance-final fall) as in the sentence below\is{declarative intonation}. The iteration of the NP in estómago ‘her stomach’ in \REF{ex:key:162} conveys a repetitive and emphatic meaning in very much the same way as the verb-object phrase kɔ́t=an ‘cut=\textsc{3sg.obj}’ in \REF{ex:key:157}:,ex:key:162,Not found,ex:key:157,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some words feature a pitch configuration suggestive of reduplication, others feature a configuration that points towards repetition. The former group comprises cases of lexicalised iterations (\ref{ex:key:164}a) with no attested simplex form but whose etymology can be established. It also encompasses words with identical components, of which the origin of the simplex form is difficult or impossible to establish – these words are probably reflexes of English or Portuguese lexicalised iterations (b). The group also contains words which have a deducible, but idiosyncratic semantic relation with a simplex form (c). With all these words, we find an L tone over the first component of the word, while the second component bears an H tone. Hence this is the pitch configuration that we have already seen with iterative, verbal reduplication in section \sectref{sec:4.5.1}.

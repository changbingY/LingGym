Suprasegmental phonology,Characteristics of tone\label{sec:3.1,Lexical and morphological tone,,,"A small number of monosyllabic roots are distinguished from each other by pitch alone.

Suprasegmental phonology,Characteristics of tone\label{sec:3.1,Lexical and morphological tone,,,"Morphological tone is employed in the personal pronoun paradigm in order to distinguish morphologically different forms of the same lexeme from one another (e.g. mi \textsc{‘1sg.poss’} – mí \textsc{‘1sg.indp’}, dɛn ‘\textsc{3pl}’ – dɛ́n ‘\textsc{3pl.indp}’). Pichi also features a morphological tonal process (cf. \sectref{sec:3.2.4}). In addition, there are three items that derive from a common etymon and are distinguished by pitch alone: de ‘\textsc{ipfv}’ – dé ‘\textsc{be}.\textsc{loc}’, di \textsc{‘def’} – dí ‘this’, go ‘pot’ – gó ‘go’). All low-toned monosyllabic roots are words with more or less grammatical functions, such as personal pronouns (e.g. a ‘\textsc{1sg.sbj}’), determiners (e.g. di ‘\textsc{def}’), TMA markers (e.g. bin ‘\textsc{pst}’, kin ‘\textsc{hab}’), clause linkers (e.g. ɛf ‘if’), or prepositions (e.g. pan ‘on’). Low-toned function words, except dependent personal pronouns, are listed in \REF{ex:key:49}.",ex:key:49,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Suprasegmental phonology,Characteristics of tone\label{sec:3.1,Tone classes\label{sec:3.1.3,,,"About 95 per cent of roots contained in my lexical data-base carry a single H tone over their only, penultimate, or final syllable. Other syllables in these words are L-toned. The remaining 5 per cent of roots feature diverse tone patterns with more than one H, or no H tone. Many (e.g. nyɔ́ní ‘ant’ < \ili{Mende} yɔ́ní ‘red ant’) but not all (e.g. ápás ‘after’ < \ili{English} ‘half-past’) of these words originate from African languages or are monosyllabic function words with an L tone over their only syllable (cf. \ref{ex:key:49}), while words with a single H tone are mostly English-derived. This circumstance speaks to the fact that stress-to-tone conversion took place in the formation of the proto-language of Pichi, as in many other Afro-European creole and non-creole contact languages (e.g. \citealt{Berry1970,Criper1971,Criper-Friedman1990,Alleyne1980,GussenhovenUdofot2010,Steien2015}).",ex:key:49,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Suprasegmental phonology,Tonal processes\label{sec:3.2,Tone spreading\label{sec:3.2.1,,,"A second phono-syntactic environment that favours rightward H tone spreading is a modifier-noun phrase. The L-toned syllable of a bisyllabic property item in prenominal position and with an H.L pattern may be raised to H if it is immediately followed by a noun with an initial (or only) H tone. An example for this process is provided in \REF{ex:key:58} further below. In the NP, the L-toned syllable of the modifier fúlis ‘foolish’ is raised to an H tone because it is followed by the H-toned noun mán ‘man’.",ex:key:58,\glll Fúlis mán. | \gls H.H H | foolish man,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

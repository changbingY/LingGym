Segmental phonology,Phonological processes\label{sec:2.5,Nasals and nasal place assimilation\label{sec:2.5.2,,,"Before a pause, hence when there is no assimilatory pressure from following segments, the word-final nasal in these function words may either be realised as [n] or [m], as in \REF{ex:key:32} and \REF{ex:key:33}, respectively. The analysis of a subcorpus revealed that two thirds of prepausal instances of the word-final nasal were realised as [n], with the remaining third being realised as [m]. Instances of prepausal kán necessarily involve the content word ‘come’ rather than the homonymous preverbal aspect marker kán ‘\textsc{pfv}’. The Pichi equivalent of the content word ‘come’ is more often pronounced as [kám] than [kán] \REF{ex:key:34}:",ex:key:32,Not found,ex:key:33,Not found,ex:key:34,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Segmental phonology,Phonological processes\label{sec:2.5,Vowel assimilation\label{sec:2.5.3,,,"Pichi features a tongue root vowel harmony targeting mid-vowels. The distinction between the [+high] vowel /e/ and the [-high] vowel /ɛ/, and between [+high] /o/ and \mbox{[-high]} /ɔ/ is collapsed in stem vowels. Enclitics and adjoining function words harmonise with the stem. Hence we find dɛn de kéch dɛ́n → [den de kéch dén] ‘they [\textsc{ipfv}] catch them’. Compare \REF{ex:key:35} and \REF{ex:key:36}.

Segmental phonology,Phonological processes\label{sec:2.5,Insertion and deletion\label{sec:2.5.4,,,"We have seen that the insertion of consonants affects various types of words (cf. \sectref{sec:2.5.2} and the entries /h/, /s/, /j/, and /n/ in \sectref{sec:2.6.2.1}). Deletion is less frequent. In general, vowels and consonants of content words tend to be fully articulated (except cf. \ref{ex:key:39}–\ref{ex:key:40}). Nevertheless, high-frequency (function) words tend to be phonologically reduced or fused with adjoining words to a greater degree than other words. One function word, the TMA marker nɛ́a ‘\textsc{neg.prf}’, is not pronounced as the fuller variant [nɛ́và{\textasciitilde}nɛ́bà] in natural speech in the corpus. The virtually complete sound change of this TMA marker is reflected in the orthographic choice of nɛ́a \REF{ex:key:38}.",ex:key:39,Not found,ex:key:40,Not found,ex:key:38,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Segmental phonology,Phonological processes\label{sec:2.5,Insertion and deletion\label{sec:2.5.4,,,"The tendency to avoid clustering also frequently leads to the insertion of an epenthetic vowel into coda consonant clusters featuring liquid-stop sequences. Hence, with the three possible coda clusters /lp/, /lt/, and /lk/ (cf. \tabref{tab:key:2.8}), insertion produces free variants like hɛ́lp [hɛ́lp{\textasciitilde}hɛ́lɛ̀p] ‘help’, bɛ́lt [bɛ́lt{\textasciitilde}bɛ́lɛ̀t], and milk [mílk{\textasciitilde}mílìk] ‘milk’. In addition, Pichi speakers manifest a marked tendency to avoid the clustering of consonants across word boundaries.

Segmental phonology,Phonotactics\label{sec:2.6,The syllable\label{sec:2.6.2,Distribution of vowels and approximants\label{sec:2.6.2.2,,"A comparison of \tabref{tab:key:2.9} and \tabref{tab:key:2.10} shows that opening sequences are realised as vowel-vowel sequences, while closing sequences are realised as vowel-approximant strings. The circumstances surrounding cliticisation \is{cliticisation}speak to the validity of differentiating between vowel-vowel and vowel-approximant sequences. Due to a restriction imposed by tonal phonotactics, =an may not encliticise to a vowel-terminal host if the final vowel of the host carries a low tone (cf. \sectref{sec:3.2.5}). Monosyllabic verbs featuring an approximant as the final segment may, however, take the object pronoun =an.

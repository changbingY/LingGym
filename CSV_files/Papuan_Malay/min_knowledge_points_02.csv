The 1,497 lexemes are extracted from the 2,458-item \isi{word list}, mentioned in §\ref{Para_1.11.6}. The native consonant and vowel phoneme inventories are presented in §\ref{Para_2.1}. The phonological changes that the consonant and vowel segments can undergo are discussed in §\ref{Para_2.2}. A number of surface phenomena are described in §\ref{Para_2.3}. The phonotactics of Papuan Malay are investigated in §\ref{Para_2.4}, including a discussion of the segment distribution and possible sequences, syllable structures, and stress patterns. As already mentioned in §\ref{Para_1.11.6}, the corpus also includes a large number of loanwords; so far 719 items of the 2,458-item \isi{word list} (29%) have been identified. Papuan Malay has also adopted one loan segment, the voiceless labio-dental fricative /\textstyleChCharisSIL{f}/, and developed three substitution strategies to realize another \isi{non-native segment}, the voiceless postalveolar fricative /\textstyleChCharisSIL{ʃ}/.

Papuan Malay has a clear preference for disyllabic roots and CV(C) syllables (see §\ref{Para_2.4.3}), and stress typically falls on the penultimate syllable (see §\ref{Para_2.4.4}). The corpus contains 26 lexical roots with an /\textstyleChCharisSIL{ai}/ or /\textstyleChCharisSIL{au}/ vowel combination. Of these, 13 are analyzed as VC combinations (eight /aj/ and five /aw/ combinations). The remaining 13 vowel combination are analyzed as vowel sequences (eight /a.i/ and five /a.u/ sequences). These 13 vowel sequences occur in lexical roots with penultimate stress; that is, /a/ belongs to the stressed penultimate syllable, while the close vowel belongs to the unstressed ultimate syllable. If these 13 sequences are analyzed as diphthongs instead, the \isi{syllable structure} of the respective roots changes and 12 of them become monosyllabic. This increases the number of monosyllabic roots from 44 to 56, an increase of 27%. Such an increase, however, seems to be disproportionally high given the strong preference for disyllabic roots.

If /\textstyleChCharisSIL{ai}/ is analyzed as a diphthong, stress instead falls on the dispreferred ultimate syllable, [\textstyleChCharisSIL{mu.ˈdʒair}]. Further, as mentioned above, the actual pronunciation of the /\textstyleChCharisSIL{ai}/ or /\textstyleChCharisSIL{au}/ vowel combinations does not suggest that they are V.V sequences.

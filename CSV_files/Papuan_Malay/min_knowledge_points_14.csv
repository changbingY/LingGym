,Introduction,,,,The lack of a clear opposition between coordination and dependency in terms of structural relations also applies to clause combining in Papuan Malay: clauses marked with a \isi{conjunction} are not distinct from unmarked clauses in terms of their morphosyntax and word order. This is shown in (\ref{Example_14.1}) to (\ref{Example_14.3}) with purpose-marking \textitbf{supaya} ‘so that’. Omitting the \isi{conjunction} from the two purpose clauses in (\ref{Example_14.1}) leaves two grammatically complete and correct clauses: \textitbf{saya harus kas makang dia} ‘I have to give him/her food’ and \textitbf{dia kenal saya lebi} ‘he/she can know me better’.,Example_14.1,"\gll saya harus kas makang dia, supaya dia kenal saya lebi dekat, supaya de bisa taw saya punya nama | \gls 1sg have.to give eat 3sg so.that 3sg know 1sg more near so.that 3sg be.able know 1sg poss name | \glt ‘I have to give him/her food",Example_14.3,Not found,Example_14.1,"\gll saya harus kas makang dia, supaya dia kenal saya lebi dekat, supaya de bisa taw saya punya nama | \gls 1sg have.to give eat 3sg so.that 3sg know 1sg more near so.that 3sg be.able know 1sg poss name | \glt ‘I have to give him/her food",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Introduction,,,,"When a \isi{conjunction} is missing an argument, the result is still a grammatically complete and correct clause. In the purpose clause in (\ref{Example_14.2}), for instance, the subject \textitbf{obat} ‘medicine’ is elided. This \isi{elision}, however, does not signify a grammaticalized gap that signals the dependent status of the purpose clause marked with \textitbf{supaya} ‘so that’. Instead, the \isi{elision} is due to the fact that speakers often omit arguments and other constituents if these can be inferred. In (\ref{Example_14.2}) the elided subject \textitbf{obat} ‘medicine’ is understood from the context.",Example_14.2,"\gll ibu itu de mo kasi obat, tapi ko harus priksa dara, supaya Ø harus cocok | \gls woman d.dist 3sg want give medicine but 2sg have.to check blood so.that ... have.to be.suitable | \glt ‘that lady, she wants to give (you) medicine, but you have to (get your) blood checked",Example_14.2,"\gll ibu itu de mo kasi obat, tapi ko harus priksa dara, supaya Ø harus cocok | \gls woman d.dist 3sg want give medicine but 2sg have.to check blood so.that ... have.to be.suitable | \glt ‘that lady, she wants to give (you) medicine, but you have to (get your) blood checked",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is a generalized phenomenon, as demonstrated with the reported \isi{direct speech} in (\ref{Example_14.3}) (see also §\ref{Para_11.1}). The original utterance is given in (\ref{Example_14.3a}), while in (\ref{Example_14.3b}) the elided constituents are given in brackets, such as \isi{purposive} \textitbf{supaya} ‘so that’\footnote{Alternatively, the \isi{conjunction} \textitbf{sampe} ‘until, with the result that’ could fill this slot.} or the subject of the purpose clause, \textitbf{kaki} ‘foot, leg’.",Example_14.3,Not found,Para_11.1,Not found,Example_14.3a,Not found,Example_14.3b,"\gll ... malam Kapolsek bilang, kalo [kam] dapat [dia,] tembak [de pu] kaki [supaya] [kaki] pata | \gls ... night head.of.district.police say if [2pl] get [3sg] shoot [3sg poss] foot [so.that] [foot] break | \glt [Reply to the question about who the police were looking for:] ‘[(they’re looking for Martin ...,] (last) night the head of the district police said, ``if (you) get (him), shoot (his) leg (",,,,,,,,,,,,
,Introduction,,,,"In addition to the 21 conjunctions combining same-type constituents, Papuan Malay also has two conjunctions which link different-type constituents, namely \isi{complementizer} \textitbf{bahwa} ‘so that’ and \isi{relativizer} \textitbf{yang} ‘\textsc{rel}’. Both are subordinating conjunctions, in that they “serve to integrate a {\ldots} clause into some larger construction”, adopting \citegen[45]{Schachter.2007} definition. Complementizer \textitbf{bahwa} ‘that’ marks a clause as an argument of the \isi{verb} as illustrated in (\ref{Example_14.4}), while \isi{relativizer} \textitbf{yang} ‘\textsc{rel}’ integrates a relative clause within a \isi{noun} phrase as demonstrated in (\ref{Example_14.5}).",Example_14.4,\gll sa cuma taw bahwa de ada di sini | \gls 1sg just know that 3sg exist at l.prox | \glt ‘I just know,Example_14.5,\gll baru Iskia dia pegang sa punya lutut yang tida baik | \gls and.then Iskia 3sg hold 1sg poss knee rel neg be.good | \glt ‘and then Iskia held my knee,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Typically, the relative clause follows its head nominal, as in (\ref{Example_14.59}) and (\ref{Example_14.61a}). However, \textitbf{yang} ‘\textsc{rel}’ can also introduce a headless relative clause. Cross-linguistically, headless relative clauses can be used “when the head \isi{noun} is non-specific” or when “the specific reference to the head is clear” \citep[295]{Payne.1997}. This also applies to Papuan Malay. In (\ref{Example_14.60}), for instance, the head nominal is non-specific, while in (\ref{Example_14.61b}) the reference to the head is clear (“Ø” signifies the implied head nominal).",Para_8.2.8,Not found,Example_14.59,\gll kitong mo hancurkang \textbf{tugu} \textbf{yang} ada di Sarmi itu | \gls 1PL want shatter monument REL exist at Sarmi D.DIST | \glt ‘we want to destroy \textbf{the statue that} is in Sarmi there’,Example_14.61a,\gll Speaker-1: \textbf{Nelci} \textbf{itu} \textbf{yang} mana? | \gls ...

These findings reflect the results of \citegen{Stassen.2000} typological study of \isi{noun} phrase \isi{conjunction} which shows that \isi{juxtaposition} is “a minor strategy” which is often used “in list-like enumerations”.\footnote{According to \citet[7–8]{Stassen.2000}, “the general trend all over the world is that zero-coordination tends to be marginalized into specific functions or is replaced altogether by overt marking strategies”. \citet[351–357]{Mithun.1988} suggests that this development is due to the global increase in bilingualism and in literacy. With respect to bilingualism, \citet[351]{Mithun.1988} observes that “an astonishing number of coordinating conjunctions have been recently borrowed into languages that previously had none”. As for the role of literacy, \citet[356]{Mithun.1988} notes that, whereas in oral language intonation suffices to signal the syntactic structure of juxtaposed constituents, written language requires the overt and “systematic specification of the precise nature of link” to disambiguate syntactic relations.}",Example_14.68,\gll gúntur kílat hújang itu dia sambar ruma itu sampeee | \gls thunder lightning rain d.dist 3sg strike.one.after.the.other house d.dist reach | \glt ‘that,Example_14.73,"\gll Oktofernus tra makang, Mateus tra makang, Wili tra makang, e, paytua tra makang | \gls Oktofernus neg eat Mateus neg eat Wili neg eat uh husband neg eat | \glt ‘",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Juxtaposition,,,,"Papuan Malay combines different prosodic features to indicate the structure of the juxtaposed \isi{noun} phrases: final vowel \isi{lengthening} (orthographically represented by a sequence of three vowels), slight increase in pitch of the stressed syllable (“~\'{~}~”), intonation breaks (“{\textbar}”), non-final intonation pattern with level pitch \mbox{(“ -- ”)}, and end-of-list intonation with fall pitch (“{\textbackslash}”).

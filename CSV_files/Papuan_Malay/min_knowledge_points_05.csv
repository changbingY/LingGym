,Introduction\label{Para_5.1,,,,"The notion of “word class” is defined as a class of “words that share morphological or syntactic properties” {\citep[5188]{Asher.1994}}. In general, pertinent criteria for establishing class membership are a “word’s distribution, its range of syntactic functions, and the morphological or syntactic categories for which it is specifiable” \citep[1–2]{Schachter.2007}. In Papuan Malay, morphological criteria do not play a major role in distinguishing different word classes, given the lack of inflectional \isi{morphology} and the rather limited productivity of derivational patterns (see §\ref{Para_3.1}). Instead the main criteria for defining distinct word classes are their syntactic properties.",Para_3.1,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Introduction\label{Para_5.1,,,,"Based on their syntactic properties, three open and several closed lexical classes are distinguished. It is acknowledged, however, that Papuan Malay has membership overlap between a number of categories (see §\ref{Para_5.14}). Most of this \isi{variation} involves verbs, including overlap between verbs and nouns, which is typical of Malay varieties and other western \ili{Austronesian} languages. In discussing lexical and syntactic categories in western \ili{Austronesian} languages,\footnote{More specifically, \citet[112]{Himmelmann.2005} refers to western \ili{Austronesian} “symmetrical voice languages”, that is languages that have “at least two voice alternations marked on the \isi{verb}, neither of which is clearly the basic form”.}",Para_5.14,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Introduction\label{Para_5.1,,,,"In discussing Papuan Malay lexical and syntactic categories in this grammar, nouns and verbs are analyzed as belonging to distinct word classes, in spite of the attested \isi{variation} in membership, discussed in §\ref{Para_5.14}. This approach is chosen because of the distinct syntactic properties of the categories under discussion, as shown in more detail throughout this chapter. In cases of \isi{variation}, the category membership of a given lexeme can usually be deduced from the context in which an utterance occurs. Rather than proposing additional special word classes for lexical items with dual distribution, the lexemes in question are analyzed as having dual class membership and the \isi{variation} as involving zero conversion.",Para_5.14,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Introduction\label{Para_5.1,,,,"In the next two sections, the two major open lexical classes of nouns and verbs are discussed. The class of nouns, described in §\ref{Para_5.2}, includes common nouns, proper nouns, location, and direction nouns.

Adverbs, discussed in §\ref{Para_5.4}, constitute the third open word class. The closed word classes are then described, that is, personal pronouns in §\ref{Para_5.5}, demonstratives in §\ref{Para_5.6}, locatives in §\ref{Para_5.7}, interrogatives in §\ref{Para_5.8}, numerals in §\ref{Para_5.9}, quantifiers in §\ref{Para_5.10}, prepositions in §\ref{Para_5.11}, and conjunctions in §\ref{Para_5.12}.

Second, manner is expressed through stative verbs (see §\ref{Para_5.4.8}). Third, reduplicated verbs can receive an adverbial reading due to an \isi{interpretational shift}.

Depending on their positions within the clause, the adverbs differ in terms of their semantic effect. Generally speaking, prepredicate adverbs which precede the subject have scope over the entire proposition. The semantic effect of prepredicate adverbs which directly precede the predicate and of postpredicate adverbs is more limited.

More specifically, \textitbf{blum} ‘not yet’ indicates that the event or state denoted by the \isi{verb} is not yet completed or has not yet occurred, while \textitbf{masi} ‘still’ signals that the event or state is still continuing. Aspectual \textitbf{suda} ‘already’, by contrast, has a retrospective meaning; that is, it marks “a realized transition in the past”, again employing Smessaert and ter Meulen’s (\citeyear*[221]{Smessaert.2004}) terminology (\textitbf{suda} ‘already’ is very often shortened to \textitbf{su}). Besides, \textitbf{suda} ‘already’ can signal \isi{imperative} mood, in which case it occurs in clause-final position, as discussed in §\ref{Para_13.3}. Progressive aspect is not encoded by an ad\isi{verb} but with the existential \isi{verb} \textitbf{ada} ‘exist’; for expository reasons, however, the progressive marking function of \textitbf{ada} ‘exist’ is discussed here (existential clauses are discussed in §\ref{Para_11.4}).",Para_13.3,Not found,Para_11.4,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

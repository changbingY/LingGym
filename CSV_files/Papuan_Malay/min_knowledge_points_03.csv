Therefore, if better-educated speakers employ a particular affix considerably more often than less-educated ones, this is taken as evidence that the affixed lexemes are not the result of a productive process but that they constitute code-switches with Indonesian.

This notion of topical regulation suggests that Papuan Malay speakers consider Indonesian, and not Papuan Malay, the appropriate language to use when discussing \textsc{high} topics associated with formal domains such as politics, education, or religion. Therefore, if Papuan Malay speakers use a particular affix much more often when discussing \textsc{high} topics than when discussing casual daily-life issues (\textsc{low} topics), this is taken as evidence that the affixed lexemes are code-switches with Indonesian. This applies especially to less-educated Papuans, as better-educated Papuans already display a general tendency to include Indonesian features when speaking Papuan Malay, although this tendency is more pronounced when the latter discuss \textsc{high} topics.

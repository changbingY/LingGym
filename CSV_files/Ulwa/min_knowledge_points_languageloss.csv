The structural consequences of language loss\label{sec:15,Phonological changes\label{sec:15.2,,,,"Even though the number of native \isi{lexical} items used in speech appears to have diminished, even among the oldest speakers, Ulwa’s native \isi{phonology} seems still to be intact. In other words, there are not any indications that older speakers have \isi{shift}ed their \is{phonology} phonologies due to influences from \ili{Tok Pisin}. In fact, many speakers impose Ulwa \isi{phonotactics} on their variety of \ili{Tok Pisin}.

This may have been derived thanks to the very similar role of stap ‘be’ in \ili{Tok Pisin}.

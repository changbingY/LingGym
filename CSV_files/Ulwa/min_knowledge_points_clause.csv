In the remainder of this section I describe how ‘showing’ events are encoded in Ulwa. Whereas ‘giving’ events in Ulwa are encoded with two \isi{transitive} verbs (typically tï- ‘take’ and na- ‘give’), ‘showing’ events are encoded with a single \isi{intransitive} verb (si- ‘push’). In other contexts, this verb is used \isi{transitive}ly \REF{ex:clause:49}, often in conjunction with the verb lï- ‘put’, to covey the sense of something being pushed upon something else, as in \REF{ex:clause:50} and \REF{ex:clause:51}, or in conjunction with the preverbal form [ikali] (literally ‘hand-send’) to convey the act of grabbing, holding, or catching, as in \REF{ex:clause:52} and \REF{ex:clause:53}.\footnote{Like tï- ‘take’, si- ‘push’ is often \isi{defective} in that it commonly lacks \isi{perfective} or \isi{imperfective} \isi{aspect} marking.}",ex:clause:49,\gsrc Ndin u itïtïl \textbf{ndïse}. | \gll ndï=in u itïtïl ndï=\textbf{si}-e | \gls 3PL=in from dust 3PL=push-IPFV | \glt `[I] was pushing the dust out from them.’,ex:clause:50,\gsrc Unap \textbf{ndïs} apïn \textbf{lïp}. | \gll u=nap ndï=\textbf{si} apïn \textbf{lï}-p | \gls 2SG=for 3PL=push fire put-PFV | \glt `[They] put them on the fire for you.’,ex:clause:51,"\gsrc Nawoli mangusuwa imbake apa i wutï \textbf{si} \textbf{nimbamlïp}. | \gll Nawoli ma-ngusuwa imba-ka-e apa i wutï \textbf{si} nï=imbam-\textbf{lï}-p | \gls [name] 3SG.OBJ{-}poor night-at-DEP house go.PFV leg push 1SG=under-put-PFV | \glt `Nawoli, the poor thing, came to [my] house at night and put [his] legs under me.’",ex:clause:52,\gsrc Nungol mï \textbf{ikali} \textbf{mas}. | \gll nungol mï \textbf{i-kali} ma=\textbf{si} | \gls child 3SG.SUBJ hand-send 3SG.OBJ=push | \glt `The son grabbed it.’,ex:clause:53,\gsrc U wa li mama \textbf{ikali masina}? | \gll u wa li ma=ma \textbf{i-kali} ma=\textbf{si}-na | \gls 2SG just down 3SG.OBJ=go hand-send 3SG.OBJ=push-IRR | \glt `You’ll just go down there and grab it?’,,,,,,,,,,

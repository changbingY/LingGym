This meaning is very close to that of a purposive clause `in order to clean pans'. An instrumental participial relative clause in essive function could thus easily be reanalyzed as a purposive clause, and hence the oblique participle as a purposive converbal.",ex:tWthW.sAXtCi,"\gll ɣzɯtʰɯz nɯ kɯɕɯŋgɯ tɕe [tɯtʰɯ sɤ-χtɕi] ɲɯ́-wɣ-nɯ-pʰɯt pɯ-ŋgrɤl | \gls Selaginella DEM in.the.past LNK pan OBL:PCP-wash IPFV-INV-AUTO-uproot PST.IPFV-be.usually.the.case | \glt `In the past, people would dig up Selaginella [to use as] a pan cleaner.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Non-finite verbal morphology \label{chap:non-finite,Historical perspectives \label{sec:nmlz.historical.perspectives,Dental non-finite prefixes \label{sec:dental.nmlz.history,,,"Since bare infinitives and dental infinitives are in complementary distribution, the former being used with transitive verbs and the latter with intransitive ones (see §\ref{sec:bare.inf.complement} and §\ref{sec:dental.inf.complement}), it is legitimate to consider the possibility that both forms go back to a single category. The bare infinitive takes a possessive prefix that is coreferent with the object of the verb; intransitive verbs lack an object (semi-transitive verbs have a semi-object §\ref{sec:semi.object}, but its morphosyntactic properties are different from those of canonical objects), and thus if a bare infinitive were built from an intransitive verb, one would only have three choices: (i) index the subject, (ii) use the bare stem with any possessive prefix or (iii) use a `dummy' possessive prefix indicating the absence of object. It is possible to argue that dental infinitives correspond to solution (iii), and that the \forme{tɯ-} prefix in this form is the indefinite possessor \forme{tɯ-} (§\ref{sec:indef.genr.poss}). In this hypothesis, dental infinitives taking a possessive prefix (see example \ref{ex:tWtAmdzW.kWBdi} in §\ref{sec:dental.inf.complement}) are later creations, made after the etymological origin of the \forme{tɯ-} had become obscured.",ex:tWtAmdzW.kWBdi,\gll tɯ-tɯ-ɤmdzɯ kɯ-βdi mɤ-kɯ-βdi kɯnɤ ʑo cʰɯ-sɤfɕɤra-nɯ pɯ-ɕti. | \gls GENR:POSS-NMLZ:DEG-sit INF:STAT-be.well NEG-INF:STAT-be.well also EMPH IPFV-discuss-PL PST.IPFV-be.AFF:FACT | \glt `People would discuss whether one sat properly or not.',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

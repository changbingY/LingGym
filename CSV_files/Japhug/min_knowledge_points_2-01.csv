Phonology \label{chap:phono,Consonants,Codas \label{sec:codas.inventory,,,"First, when the \textsc{1sg} \forme{-a} suffix is added to a verb stem ending in a fricative coda, that coda is resyllabified, becoming the onset of the syllable with \forme{a} as rhyme. In these cases, the voiced allophone always surfaces (§\ref{sec:intr.1}): for instance the \textsc{1sg\fl{}3sg} Imperfective of \japhug{ntɕʰoz}{use} is \forme{tu-ntɕʰóz-a}, syllabified as \ipa{tu.ntɕʰo.za}. If one were to assume that the fricative coda \forme{-z} were voiceless or underspecified for voicing, a context-specific voicing rule would have to be assumed to have taken place, since \forme{V́sa} is a permissible sequence in Japhug, as in \forme{pjɤ́-wɣ-sat} \textsc{ifr}-\textsc{inv}-kill (see for instance example \ref{ex:pjArwGrzWrzWG} in §\ref{sec:denom.tr.rA}). It is more economical to assume that \forme{-z} and the other fricative codas are underlying voiced, and become devoiced in the same contexts as the sonorants.",ex:pjArwGrzWrzWG,"\gll pjɤ́-wɣ-rɤ-rzɯ\redp{}rzɯɣ tɕe kɯβde-rzɯɣ ʑo tó-wɣ-lɤt, pjɤ́-wɣ-sat. | \gls IPFV-INV-DENOM-EMPH\redp{}section LNK four-section EMPH IFR-INV-release IFR-INV-kill | \glt `[The thief] killed him by cutting him into four pieces.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Phonology \label{chap:phono,Consonants,Codas \label{sec:codas.inventory,,,"Second, the locative postposition \forme{zɯ} (§\ref{sec:core.locative}) is the result of the degrammaticalization of the locative \forme{*-s} suffix still attested in Situ (§\ref{ex:word.vs.clitic.postp}).

Phonology \label{chap:phono,Word structure,Wordhood \label{sec:wordhood,,,"The clearest phonological criterion for wordhood is stress. Stress is by default word-final, and words have at most one stress. Most function words, including linkers (§\ref{sec:coordination}), determiners (§\ref{sec:determiners}), postpositions (§\ref{ex:postpositions}) and even relator nouns (§\ref{sec:relator.nouns}) lack stress (unless they receive special emphasis).

Phonology \label{chap:phono,Word structure,Wordhood \label{sec:wordhood,,,"There are, however, three problems challenging the notion of `word' in Japhug: clitized sentence final particles (§\ref{sec:verb.enclitics}), bipartite verbs (§\ref{sec:bipartite}) and prenominal attributes (§\ref{ex:attributive.prenominal}) when they receive no stress.

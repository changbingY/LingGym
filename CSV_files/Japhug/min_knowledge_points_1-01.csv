Introduction,The Japhug language,,,,"Situ Gyalrong and Amdo Tibetan used to be the two dominant languages in the area, and many speakers of Japhug also have a passive understanding of Situ, and sometimes also of Tshobdun and Zbu. There is no immediate intercomprehensibility between Gyalrong languages, and speakers of Japhug reportedly need several months to acquire basic conversational skills in Tshobdun.\footnote{See for example (\ref{ex:nW.mACtsxa}) (§\ref{sec:terminative}), (\ref{ex:nWlWz.thWkWGe.tsa}) (§\ref{sec:relative.postverbal}) and (\ref{ex:mAkABzu.mWjkHW}) (§\ref{sec:ra.khW.jAG.verb}), where Tshendzin recounts her experience as a teacher in Tshobdun village, where she had to learn Tshobdun to make herself understood by the pupils' parents. }",ex:nW.mACtsxa,"\gll kɤ-sɤŋo ʁɟa qʰe, nɯ-mtɕʰi kɤ-χpjɤt ʁɟa kɯ kú-wɣ-spa ɕti. nɯ mɤɕtʂa mɤ-kʰɯ. | \gls INF-hear completely LNK 3PL.POSS-mouth INF-observe completely ERG IPFV-INV-be.able be.AFF:FACT DEM until NEG-be.possible:FACT | \glt `(In order to learn the Tshobdun language, since it has no writing system), one has no choice but to listen and observe people's mouth to learn it, otherwise it is not possible.'",ex:nWlWz.thWkWGe.tsa,"\gll [nɯ-lɯz tʰɯ-kɯ-ɣe tsa] nɯra tɕe, ʁdɯrɟɤt ɯ-skɤt tu-βze-a ɲɯ-tso-nɯ, | \gls 3PL.POSS-age AOR-SBJ:PCP-come[II] a.little DEM:PL LNK TOPO 3SG.POSS-language IPFV-make[II]-1SG SENS-understand-PL | \glt `Those who are a little older understand when I speak the [Japhug] language of Gdongbrgyad.

Introduction,The Japhug corpus,,,,"Since speakers I have worked with only recount a limited number of traditional stories (some of which in any case are from written sources; in particular, the story `The fox' \japhdoi{0004087} told by Kunbzang Mtsho is clearly adapted from the Grimm fairy tale `Der goldene Vogel'), I have resorted to translation from Chinese to collect a larger corpus. Tshendzin provided surprisingly idiomatic renderings of various storybooks for children (including Grimm tales, Andersen tales, Liaozhai zhiyi \zh{聊斋志异}, Arabian nights and Xiyouji \zh{西游记}). These documents are not given the same value as more spontaneous texts, and are systematically indicated by adding the extension ``-zh"" to the document name. Systematic comparison with the original text is offered whenever any suspicion of calque from Chinese exists. However, the immense morphosyntactic difference between Chinese and Japhug makes it necessary to completely rework the structure of the sentences in most cases (see for instance \ref{ex:CWmaqʰua}, §\ref{sec:apprehensive.function}), so that even if there is undoubtedly influence from Chinese, even the way Chinese is adapted into Japhug is itself an interesting topic of research.",ex:CWmaqʰua,"\gll [ɕɯ-maqʰu-a kɯ ʑo] ɲɤ-sɯso-nɯ tɕe rcanɯ, pɕoʁʑi kɯβde ʑo jo-ɣi-nɯ. | \gls APPR-be.after-1SG SFP EMPH IFR-think LNK unexpectedly corner four EMPH IFR-come-PL | \glt `Afraid of being late (thinking `I am afraid that I will be late'), they came from the four corners of the world.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Introduction,Language and culture,,,,"This work focuses on the grammar of the language, and only contains a single chapter (\ref{chap:kinship}, on the kinship system) dedicated to ethnology. However, the corpus that has been collected contains many traditional stories, as well as procedural texts describing the traditional life before massive sinicization. Examples from these texts are found on nearly all the pages of this grammar, and their interest is not purely linguistic. Thus, the section on place names presents a mythological story explaining the origin of a name (\ref{ex:qaprANar.kW}, §\ref{sec:place.names}), the chapter on orientation preverbs contains an account of the traditional living-room/kitchen (§\ref{sec:orientation.kitchen}) and an introduction to weaving (§\ref{sec:orientation.loom}), and the section on antipassive derivations includes a passage on rain-calling and mountain tutelary spirits (see example \ref{ex:znArGAma}, §\ref{sec:antipassive.avoidance}). In this sense, traditional culture permeates this grammar from beginning till end.",ex:qaprANar.kW,"\gll tɕe tɯ-mɯ lɤt tɤkʰa tɕe, qaprɤŋar ɯ-stu ri ɲɯ-kɯ-ru tɕe zdɯm ci tu-nɯ-ɬoʁ ŋu. tʰam kɯnɤ zdɯm tu-nɯ-ɬoʁ ŋu tɕe, nɯ maka qaprɤŋar kɯ zdɯm to-tɕɤt ra tu-ti-nɯ | \gls LNK INDEF.POSS-weather release:FACT at.the.time LNK placename 3SG.POSS-direction LOC IPFV:WEST-GENR:S/O-look LNK cloud INDEF IPFV:UP-AUTO-come.out be:FACT now also cloud IPFV:UP-AUTO-come.out be:FACT LNK DEM at.all placename ERG cloud IFR-take.out PL IPFV-say-PL | \glt `And when it is about to rain, when one looks towards Qaprangar, a cloud comes out from it.

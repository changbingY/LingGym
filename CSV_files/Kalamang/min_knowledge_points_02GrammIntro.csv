Short grammatical overview of Kalamang,Morphophonology,,,,"The most common morphophonological process is the lenition\is{lenition} of intervocalic stops as illustrated in~(\ref{exe:leni}), followed by the voicing\is{assimilation} of stops following nasals as in~(\ref{exe:voici}). Assimilation of /n/ to velars and of voiceless velar /k/ to voiced\is{voicing} velar /g/ when following /n/, results in /ŋg/, a frequent sound combination illustrated in~(\ref{exe:ngg}).",exe:leni,Not found,exe:voici,Not found,exe:ngg,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Short grammatical overview of Kalamang,Morphophonology,,,,"Kalamang has few affixes and many clitics. The latter can be divided into two groups: clitics of the first type show morphophonological integration with the unit they are combined with, but can attach to different word classes (typically attaching to the rightmost member of a phrase). Object marker =at, illustrated in~\ref{exe:leni}, as well as attributive =ten, locative =ko and lative =ka (see~\ref{exe:voici} and~\ref{exe:ngg}) are examples of this type of clitic. Clitics of the second type attach to one word class only but do not show morphophonological integration with the unit they are combined with. The applicative proclitic attaches to verbs only, but no lenition takes place when the verb starts with a stop, as illustrated in~(\ref{exe:kokkie}).",exe:leni,Not found,exe:voici,Not found,exe:ngg,Not found,exe:kokkie,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,
Short grammatical overview of Kalamang,"Nouns, noun phrases and postpositional phrases",,,,"There are eight other postpositions, which indicate the function of peripheral NPs. They are all enclitics that attach to the right edge of the NP. They are the comitative, instrumental, benefactive, similative, locative, ablative/allative (henceforth lative), animate locative and animate lative postpositions. These postpositions head the PP, and are illustrated in~(\ref{exe:ppfirst}) to~(\ref{exe:pplast}) on NPs consisting of a single noun.",exe:ppfirst,\gll ma=bon kiun=bon se bot | \gls 3SG=COM wife.3SG.POSS=COM IAM go | \glt `He and his wife have gone.',exe:pplast,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Short grammatical overview of Kalamang,"Nouns, noun phrases and postpositional phrases",,,,"The NP is left-headed\is{headedness}, except for nominal possessors\is{possession}, which precede the possessed noun. Besides nominal possessors, nouns can be modified by quantifiers, possessive pronouns, demonstratives, attributively used predicates and relative clauses. The relative ordering of these is not quite clear, and combinations of modifiers is very rare in the Kalamang corpus, so examples illustrating one modifier at a time are given in~(\ref{exe:balfirst}) to~(\ref{exe:ballast}).",exe:balfirst,\gll bal muap-un | \gls dog food-3POSS | \glt `the dog's food',exe:ballast,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Short grammatical overview of Kalamang,Pronouns,,,,All pronouns must be marked with object marker =at when in object position. The possibility and obligatoriness of other postposition marking varies between the paradigms. (\ref{exe:pronfirst}) to (\ref{exe:mumuinat}) illustrate the use of the pronouns.

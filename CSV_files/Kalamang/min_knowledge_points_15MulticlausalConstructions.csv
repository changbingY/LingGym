Multiclausal constructions,Conditional clauses,,,,"There are two strategies for forming conditional clauses. The first is with a dedicated conditional clitic =o/=ero `if' or concessive =taero `even if' on the condition, described in §\ref{sec:condmood}. The enclitic =o is exemplified in~(\ref{exe:waroobes}). The Malay loan kalau `if' was discussed in §\ref{sec:condconj}.",exe:waroobes,"\gll jadi tanaman pun demekian wat=\textbf{o} bes im=\textbf{o} bes sayang=\textbf{o} bes | \gls so plant even thus coconut=COND good banana=COND good nutmeg=COND good | \glt `So whichever plant [we grow], whether it's coconut, banana or nutmeg, it's good.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Multiclausal constructions,Conditional clauses,,,,"The second strategy for conditionals makes use of a clause-initial scene-setting topic\is{topic}, typically with a time adverbial\is{time adverbial}, as in~(\ref{exe:saunet})\footnote{for the similarities between conditionals and topics see \textcite{haiman1978}.}. It may be marked with \is{topic}topic marker me and/or irrealis =et (§\ref{sec:et}). The scene-setter is prosodically separate from the main clause. It ends on a high \is{pitch}pitch and is optionally followed by a pause. The scene-setter kasuret me in~(\ref{exe:kasuret}), translated as `tomorrow', can be more literally translated as `when it is tomorrow'. The conditional clause may also be followed by sequential conjunction eba `then', as in~(\ref{exe:sabeba}). An example with negative condition ge=et me `if not' is given in~(\ref{exe:getmehe}).",exe:saunet,Not found,exe:kasuret,Not found,exe:sabeba,Not found,exe:getmehe,"\gll al-un kinkinun \textbf{ge=et} \textbf{me} se rasa | \gls string-3POSS small no=IRR TOP IAM like | \glt `It has small strings, if not, it would have been good already.'",,,,,,,,,,,,
Multiclausal constructions,Conditional clauses,,,,"Below are three examples of conditional clauses with irrealis =et that are not time adverbials. (\ref{exe:haletme}) is taken from a recording where the speaker teaches the addressee how to weave a pandanus leaf envelope. (\ref{exe:raweteba}) again contains conjunction eba `then'. The combination of =et and eba does not necessarily imply a conditional reading; it must be deduced from the context. Conditional clauses with irrealis =et can be translated with either `if' or `when'. In some contexts, such as in~(\ref{exe:orkoet}), either reading seems appropriate.",exe:haletme,"\gll komahal=\textbf{et} \textbf{me} ukir=te | \gls not_understand=IRR TOP measure=IMP | \glt `If [you] don't understand, measure.'",exe:raweteba,"\gll ma rap=\textbf{et} \textbf{eba} gier-un iriskap | \gls 3SG laugh=IRR then tooth-3POSS white | \glt `When he laughs, his teeth are white.'",exe:orkoet,"\gll an or=\textbf{et} mu toni sabar-kadok=a iren, an sabar=ko=\textbf{et} mu toni or-kadok=a iren | \gls 1SG back=IRR 3PL say front-side=FOC white 1SG front=LOC=IRR 3PL say back-side=FOC white | \glt `If/when I'm in the back they say the one in the front is white, if/when I'm in the front they say the one in the back is white.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

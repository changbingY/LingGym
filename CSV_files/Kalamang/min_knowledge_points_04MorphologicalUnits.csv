Morphological units and processes,Morphological units,Particle\is{particle,,,"Se is phonologically quite dependent: it does not carry stress, and it usually obeys morphophonological rules. In the great majority of instances, when se follows a word ending in a consonant it takes the form se and when it follows a word ending in a vowel it takes the form he. Se is also grammatically dependent, in the sense that it has no meaning on its own, it does not occur on its own, and it has a fixed position in the clause: it comes right after the subject NP. In these respects se behaves like an enclitic. However, se is not bound to its phrasal host. Consider the question-answer pair in~(\ref{exe:anse}). When answering a question with a subject, se and a verb, a speaker may elide the verb, but answering with the subject and se is ungrammatical, showing that se is not bound to the subject NP.",exe:anse,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Repetition is distinguished from reduplication by two diagnostics: repetition applies to the domain of the word (such that each repeated word carries its own stress) and repetition may have two or more copies (whereas reduplication involves two copies only). Repetition is different from tail-head linking (§\ref{sec:tailhead}) in that it occurs within the clause. As an example, consider the repetition of yal `to paddle' (repeated three times, each repetition carrying a main stress) and war `to fish' in~(\ref{exe:wariw}) (repeated twice and with predicate linker =i).

Morphological units and processes,Morphological processes,Compounding,,,"Noun-verb compounds are verbs with an incorporated object noun. Noun incorporation is a process whereby a verb is derived from the compounding of a nominal root and a verbal root \parencite{mithun1984}. For Kalamang, there are two diagnostics to determine whether or not a noun is incorporated: prosody and object marking. Incorporated nouns form a prosodic unit together with the verb, such that stress is assigned on the incorporation construction (i.e. the verb with incorporated noun). In a clause with a non-incorporated noun followed by a verb each has its own stress (see §\ref{sec:stress}). The other diagnostic is object marking. Incorporated nouns lack object marking, indicating that they are no longer an argument in the clause. Both diagnostics are illustrated in the minimal example~(\ref{exe:nounincorp}).",exe:nounincorp,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

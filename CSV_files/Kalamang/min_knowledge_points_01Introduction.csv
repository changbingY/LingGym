Introduction,This study,Data and research methods\is{corpus|(,,,"To get a better understanding of certain topics that seemed worth investigating or that did not yield clear enough data in the naturalistic corpus, or to inform other people's typological studies, I also elicited data with the help of questionnaires\is{questionnaire} and video stimuli\is{stimulus!video}. I used some questionnaires and video stimuli designed by others, but also designed roughly 70 tailor-made questionnaires myself, with the aim to fill in gaps from the naturalistic spoken corpus. These tailor-made questionnaires can be found in the corpus with two-to-four-letter tags, sometimes supplemented with a two-digit indicator for a year or a running number. For example, `adj' is a questionnaire about adjectives used in 2018, and `adj19' is a questionnaire about adjectives used in 2019. These questionnaires contain a mix of requests for translations (from Indonesian or Papuan Malay) and grammaticality checks of Kalamang sentences that I constructed, typically based on a similar example from the corpus. Examples from these, as well as examples from data resulting from using other people's questionnaires and video stimuli, are referred to in this study with the tag `elic', followed by the corpus tag of the questionnaire and the line number of the example. An example is (\ref{exe:elicex}). Elicited examples are only used when no naturalistic examples are available, or when naturalistic examples do not illustrate the point clearly (for example, when there is no minimal pair available).",exe:elicex,\gll mu pas sem=ten=at koup | \gls 3PL woman afraid-ADJ=OBJ hug | \glt `They hugged the scared woman.',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Introduction,This study,Notation systems,,,"Most examples in this study are given as multi-tier glossed examples, typically consisting of three lines. On the first line, a phonemic representation of the words, divided into morphemes, is given. In most cases, the word or morpheme under discussion is in bold. This line may contain three full stops between square brackets (i.e. [...]) to indicate that a part of the original utterance is elided. I do not use punctuation in this line, because it is the underlying (phonemic) form and because it is often taken from a bigger context. The second line gives a gloss for each morpheme. The third line gives a free translation into English and the source of the utterance (see §\ref{sec:corpus}). This line includes interpunction to increase readability. Note that the interpunction, like the translation itself, is a free interpretation of the original Kalamang. This is illustrated in~(\ref{exe:kintonii}).",exe:kintonii,\gll an se toni min=kin | \gls 1SG IAM want sleep={\glkin} | \glt `I already wanted to sleep.',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Introduction,This study,Notation systems,,,"A minority of the examples contain an extra line on top with the orthographic representation of the utterance, including punctuation. This is used when intonation is considered of importance to illustrate the point made with the example. A comma indicates non-final intonation and a full stop indicates final intonation. This line may also include three full stops for a long pause, quotation marks, question marks, exclamation marks or IPA length marks. An example is~(\ref{exe:sortamm}).",exe:sortamm,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

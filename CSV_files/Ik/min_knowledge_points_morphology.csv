,Morphology\label{sec:3,Complementizers\label{sec:3.13,,,"\textsc{Complementizers} are words that introduce \isi{reported speech} or thought. For example, in the English sentence ‘She said that she agrees’, the word that is the \isi{complementizer} that introduces that reported statement she agrees. Ik has only two complementizers. One of them, \textit{tòìm\`{ɛ}nà-} ‘that’, is technically a noun and thus belongs in the noun word class. But because of its function, it is dealt with here. The word \textit{tòìm\`{ɛ}nà-}, a compound of the verb tód- ‘speak’ and mɛná- ‘words’, is used with a variety of speaking and thinking verbs. The second Ik \isi{complementizer}, tàà, is a probably a derivative of the verb kʉta ‘(s)he says’ that has been reduced over time. Even now it is usually used after the verb \textit{k\`{ʉ}t-} ‘say’. Example \REF{ex:morph:9} shows how \textit{tòìm\`{ɛ}nà-} is used in a sentence to introduce the clause \textit{mɨt{\Í}da bɔnán} ‘you are an orphan’. And example \REF{ex:morph:10} shows the \isi{complementizer} tàà introducing the clause \textit{iya ɲjíníkiʝa k\'{ɔ}\'{ɔ}kɛ} ‘our land is over there’:",ex:morph:9,\gll Hyeíá \textbf{toimɛna} mɨt{\Í}da bɔnán. | \gls know:1SG that:NOM be:2SG orphan:OBL | \glt ‘I know that you are an orphan.’,ex:morph:10,\gll Kʉta \'{ɲ}cie \textbf{taa} ia ɲjíníkiʝa k\'{ɔ}\'{ɔ}kɛ. | \gls say:3SG I:DAT that be:3SG we:land:NOM there | \glt ‘He says to me that our land is over there.’,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

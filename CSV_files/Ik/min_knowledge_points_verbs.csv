,Verbs\label{sec:8,Voice and valence\label{sec:8.6,Passive (\textsc{pass)\label{sec:8.6.1,,"Another quirky feature of the Ik \isi{passive} \{-ósí-\} is that it can function both as a \isi{passive} \isi{infinitive} suffix (taking case) and as a regular inflectional suffix followed by subject-agreement pronouns. When it is declined for case, it declines just like the transitive suffix \{-ésí-\} in \sectref{sec:8.2.2}. Example \REF{ex:verbs:1} below illustrates this in a sentence where the \isi{passive} \isi{infinitive} búdòsì- ‘to be hidden’ gets the \isi{accusative case}. Then, example \REF{ex:verbs:2} shows the same \isi{passive} acting as a verb proper, taking the 3\textsc{pl} subject-agreement pronominal suffix \{-át-\}:",ex:verbs:1,\gll B\'{ɛ}ɗáta búd\textbf{òsì}-kᵃ. | \gls want:3PL hidden:PASS-ACC | \glt ‘They want to be hidden.’,ex:verbs:2,\gll Búd\textbf{os}-átᵃ. | \gls hidden:PASS{}-3PL:REAL | \glt ‘They are hidden.’,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Verbs\label{sec:8,Voice and valence\label{sec:8.6,Impersonal \isi{passive (\textsc{ips)\label{sec:8.6.2,,"The \textsc{impersonal passive} suffix \{-àn-\} behaves like a typical \isi{passive} in that it eliminates the agent of a transitive verb and promotes the object to subject. However, unlike the \isi{passive} \{-ósí-\} described above, the impersonal \isi{passive} cannot be specified for the person or number of its subject. Instead, it remains marked for 3\textsc{sg} regardless of who or what the subject may be. Another strange property of \{-\`{a}n-\} is that it can be used with \isi{intransitive} verbs as well (just like the \isi{passive}). When used with \isi{intransitive} verbs, it has the function of downplaying the identity of the subject. For this reason, it can often be translated as ‘People {\dots}’ or ‘One {\dots}’, as in Tódian ‘People say (it)’. The impersonal \isi{passive} is a grammatical morpheme not listed in the lexicon, and so it must be illustrated in examples like \REF{ex:verbs:3}-\REF{ex:verbs:4}:",ex:verbs:3,\gll Ɨn\'{ɔ}m\'{ɛ}s\textbf{àn}{à} bì. | \gls beat:FUT:IPS you[SG]:NOM | \glt ‘You will be beaten.’,ex:verbs:4,\gll Ƙaí\textbf{án}{à} ƙàƙààƙ\`{ɔ}k\ᵋ. | \gls go:PLUR:IPS hunt:inside:DAT | \glt ‘People go hunting.’ (Lit. ‘It is gone for hunting.’),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Verbs\label{sec:8,Voice and valence\label{sec:8.6,Reciprocal (\textsc{recip)\label{sec:8.6.4,,"Like the \isi{passive} \{-ósí-\} discussed in \sectref{sec:8.6.1}, the \isi{reciprocal} suffix can take either case endings (as a morphological noun) or subject-agreement endings (as a morphological verb). A case declension of ínínósí- ‘to cohabitate’ is shown in \tabref{tab:verbs:recip2}, and in example \REF{ex:verbs:5} below, the \isi{reciprocal} verb \textit{ɨɓák{\Í}n\'{ɔ}s{\Í}-} ‘to be next to each other’ gets the \isi{accusative case}. Then, example \REF{ex:verbs:6} shows the same verb acting as a verb proper, with the 3\textsc{pl} subject-agreement marker \{-át-\}:",ex:verbs:5,\gll B\'{ɛ}ɗáta ɨɓák\textbf{{\Í}n\'{ɔ}s{\Í}}-kᵃ. | \gls want:3PL:REAL next.to:RECIP-ACC | \glt ‘They want to be next to each other.’,ex:verbs:6,\gll Ɨɓák\textbf{{\Í}n\'{ɔ}s}-átᵃ. | \gls next.to:RECIP-3PL:REAL | \glt ‘They are next to each other.’,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Verbs\label{sec:8,Subject-agreement\label{sec:8.7,,,"Whenever Ik grammar requires verbs to agree with their subjects, one of the seven pronominal suffixes in \tabref{tab:verbs:subj} are used. Note that if the verb contains [-\isi{ATR}] vowels, these suffixes will also be harmonized to [-\isi{ATR}]. Just like the free pronouns described back in \sectref{sec:5.2}, these bound pronominal suffixes are organized along three axes: 1) person (1/2/3), 2) number (singular/plural), and 3) \isi{clusivity} (exclusive/inclusive). The form these pronominals ultimately take depends on the grammatical mood of the verb to which they attach. If the verb is in the irrealis mood (see \sectref{sec:8.9.1}), the suffixes appear with their underlying forms. Whereas if they are in the realis mood (see \sectref{sec:8.9.2}), the realis suffix \{-a\} first subtracts or deletes their final vowel. The difference in the two mood-based paradigms is depicted in \tabref{tab:verbs:subj}. To see instances of the Ik subject-agreement suffixes in actual language use, you may refer back to example \REF{ex:case:11} in \sectref{sec:7.2}.",ex:case:11,\gll Ŋƙ{\Í}á tɔbɔŋ-\textbf{a}=na. | \gls eat:1SG mush-NOM=this | \glt ‘I eat this meal mush.’,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Verbs\label{sec:8,Dummy pronoun (\textsc{dp)\label{sec:8.8,,,"Examples \REF{ex:verbs:7}-\REF{ex:verbs:8} illustrate the \isi{dummy pronoun} in two different morphological forms: final and non-final. Note that the tones associated with the pronoun in these examples do not match what is shown in \tabref{tab:verbs:dummy}; this is because of local tonal interference. In terms of function, the \isi{dummy pronoun} in \REF{ex:verbs:7} indicates that an indirect object – the destination of the verb ƙáátà ‘they go (went)’ – has been displaced from its usual spot after the verb to a place of focus at the beginning of the sentence (Ntsúó). Then in \REF{ex:verbs:8}, the \isi{dummy pronoun} marks an indirect object – the location of staying – that is missing from the clause entirely. Since this sentence was taken out of context from a story, most likely the missing object had been already mentioned earlier in the discourse:",ex:verbs:7,\gll Ntsúó=noo Icéá ƙáátà-\textbf{d\ᵉ}. | \gls it:COP=PAST Ik:ACC go:3PL:REAL-DP | \glt ‘It’s where the Ik went (to).’,ex:verbs:8,\gll Jʼɛʝʉk\'{ɔ}-\textbf{\'{ɔ}} sàà ròɓàᵉ. | \gls stay:3SG:SEQ-DP other:NOM people:GEN | \glt ‘And other people stayed (there).’,ex:verbs:7,\gll Ntsúó=noo Icéá ƙáátà-\textbf{d\ᵉ}. | \gls it:COP=PAST Ik:ACC go:3PL:REAL-DP | \glt ‘It’s where the Ik went (to).’,ex:verbs:8,\gll Jʼɛʝʉk\'{ɔ}-\textbf{\'{ɔ}} sàà ròɓàᵉ. | \gls stay:3SG:SEQ-DP other:NOM people:GEN | \glt ‘And other people stayed (there).’,,,,,,,,,,,,

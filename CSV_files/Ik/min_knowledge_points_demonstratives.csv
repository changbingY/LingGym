Like the locative nominal demonstratives, these demonstratives point to a specific place – or metaphorically, a specific time – while also signifying anaphorically that that place or time is already known, either from earlier in the discourse or for some other reason. Ik has two such demonstratives with roughly the same meaning: \textit{tsʼ\'{ɛ}d\'{ɛ}-} and \textit{tʉmɛd\'{ɛ}-}, both of which are typically translated as ‘there’ or more rarely `then'.

,Case\label{sec:7,Overview\label{sec:7.1,,,"Ik has a \textsc{case} system. This means that every noun has a special marking to show what role it has in the sentence. The language marks this role by means of a set of case \textsc{suffixes} (endings). Four of the cases are marked with suffixes consisting of a single vowel, while for three others, the suffix consists of /k/ plus a vowel. An eighth case, the oblique, is marked by the absence of any suffix. In the following examples, \REF{ex:case:1}-\REF{ex:case:8}, notice how the word ŋókí- ‘dog’ at the end of each sentence has a different ending depending on the case for which it is marked:",ex:case:1,\gll Atsa ŋókᵃ. | \gls come:3SG dog:NOM | \glt ‘The dog comes.’,ex:case:8,\gll Mɨta ŋókⁱ. | \gls be:3SG dog:OBL | \glt ‘It is a dog.’,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Case\label{sec:7,Nominative (\textsc{nom)\label{sec:7.2,,,"The \textsc{nominative} case, marked by the suffix \{-a\}, is the ‘naming’ case, whose role is to: 1) mark the subject of main clauses, 2) mark the subject of sequential clauses (see \sectref{sec:8.10.7}), and 3) mark the direct object of clauses with 1\textsuperscript{st} and 2\textsuperscript{nd} person subjects (‘I’, ‘we’, ‘you’). Three examples (\REF{ex:case:9}-\REF{ex:case:11}) are provided below, each one illustrating one of the three grammatical roles of the \isi{nominative case}. The third example contains seven sentences that show how Ik object marking is \textsc{split}: objects after 3-person subjects ((s)he/it, they) take the \isi{accusative case}, while 1- or 2-person subjects (you, we) take objects in the \isi{nominative case}:\\",ex:case:9,\gll Atsáá lɔŋ\'{ɔ}t-\textbf{\ᵃ}! | \gls come:PRF enemies-NOM | \glt ‘The enemies have come!’,ex:case:11,\gll Ŋƙ{\Í}á tɔbɔŋ-\textbf{a}=na. | \gls eat:1SG mush-NOM=this | \glt ‘I eat this meal mush.’,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Case\label{sec:7,Accusative case (\textsc{acc)\label{sec:7.3,,,"The \textsc{accusative} case, marked by the suffix \{-ka\}, is also split with regard to its basic function. One of its basic functions, that for which it is named, is to mark the direct object of any clause with a 3-person subject ((s)he/it, they). Its other common function is to mark the subject and any object of several kinds of subordinate clauses (including relative and temporal clauses). Each of these functions is exemplified by one of the sentences in examples \REF{ex:case:12}-\REF{ex:case:15}. In the first example, a sentence with a 1-person subject is also given to show the contrast:\\",ex:case:12,\gll Wetésátà m\`{ɛ}s\`{ɛ}-\textbf{à} mùɲ. | \gls drink:FUT:3PL beer-ACC all | \glt ‘They will drink all the beer.’,ex:case:15,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Case\label{sec:7,Dative (\textsc{dat)\label{sec:7.4,,,"The \textsc{dative} case, marked by the suffix \{-ke\}, is the ‘to’ or ‘in’ case, whose role is to mark indirect objects (also called ‘extended’ or ‘secondary’ objects). These indirect objects may encode semantic notions like destination, location, \isi{recipient}, experiencer, \isi{possession}, and purpose. These are illustrated in examples \REF{ex:case:16}-\REF{ex:case:21}:\\",ex:case:16,\gll Ƙeesíá awá-\textbf{k\ᵉ}. | \gls go:FUT:1SG home-DAT | \glt ‘I’m going home.’,ex:case:21,\gll Ƙaa ɲera dakúáƙ\`{ɔ}-\textbf{k\ᵋ}. | \gls go:3SG girls:NOM wood:inside-DAT | \glt ‘The girls go for firewood.’,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Case\label{sec:7,Genitive (\textsc{gen)\label{sec:7.5,,,"The \textsc{genitive} case, marked by the suffix \{-e\}, is the ‘of’ case, whose role is to encode a possessive or associative relationship a noun has with another noun (or, in rare cases, with a verb). Within the broad notions of \isi{possession} and association are finer nuances such as: ownership, part-whole relationship, kinship, and attribution. These nuances are illustrated in examples \REF{ex:case:22}-\REF{ex:case:25}:\\",ex:case:22,\gll H\'{ɔ}nɨnɨ ɦyɔa ńtí-\textbf{e} ɓórékᵉ. | \gls drive:SEQ cattle:ACC they-GEN corral:DAT | \glt ‘And they drove their cattle to the corral.’,ex:case:25,\gll Maráŋá muceá bì-\textsuperscript{Ø}. | \gls good:3SG way:NOM you-GEN | \glt ‘Your luck is good.’ (lit: Your way is good.),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Case\label{sec:7,Ablative (\textsc{abl)\label{sec:7.6,,,"The \textsc{ablative} case, marked by the suffix \{-o\}, is the ‘from’ case (or in some situations `at' or `in'), whose function is to mark objects with the following semantic roles: origin/source, cause, stimulus, source of judgment, location of activity (versus static location, which is covered by the \isi{dative} case). Each of these semantic roles of the ablative are illustrated among example sentences \REF{ex:case:26}-\REF{ex:case:30}:\\",ex:case:26,\gll Atsía awá-\textbf{\ᵒ}. | \gls come:1SG home-ABL | \glt ‘I come from home.’,ex:case:30,\gll Cɛmáta sédìkà-\textbf{\ᵒ}. | \gls fight:3PL gardens-ABL | \glt ‘They are fighting in the gardens.’,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Case\label{sec:7,Instrumental (\textsc{ins)\label{sec:7.7,,,"The \textsc{instrumental} case, marked by the suffix \{-o\}, is the ‘by’ or ‘with’ case. Unlike the ablative suffix \{-o\}, the instrumental suffix is subtractive, meaning that it first deletes the noun’s final vowel. The function of the \isi{instrumental case} is to mark secondary objects with such semantic roles as instrument/means, pathway, accompaniment, manner, time, and occupation. Each of these nuances are illustrated by one sentence each in example sentences \REF{ex:case:31}-\REF{ex:case:36}:\\",ex:case:31,\gll Toɓíá=noo gasoa ɓɨs-\textbf{\ᵓ}. | \gls spear:1SG=PST warthog:NOM spear-INS | \glt ‘I speared a warthog with a spear.’,ex:case:36,\gll Cɛma fítés-\textbf{o} ƙwázìkàᵉ. | \gls fight:3SG washing-INS clothes:GEN | \glt ‘She’s washing clothes.’ (lit: ‘She is fighting with the washing of clothes.’),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Case\label{sec:7,Copulative (\textsc{cop)\label{sec:7.8,,,"The \textsc{copulative} case, marked by the suffix \{-ko\}, is the ‘is’ or ‘coupling’ case, whose function is to link one noun to another in a relationship of exact identity. In this function, the copulative marks three kinds of nouns: 1) a focused (fronted) noun, 2) the \isi{complement} of a verbless \textsc{copula} (linking verb) clause, and 3) the \isi{complement} of a \isi{negative copula} of identity clause. These different uses of the copulative are illustrated in examples sentences \REF{ex:case:37}-\REF{ex:case:41}:\\",ex:case:37,\gll Ŋ{gó-}\textbf{ó}=naa wetím. | \gls we-COP=PST drink:1PL.EXC | \glt ‘It was we (who) drank (it).’,ex:case:41,\gll Bɛna=náá \'{ɲ}cù-\textbf{k\ᵒ}. | \gls not.be:3SG=PST I-COP | \glt ‘It was not me!’,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Case\label{sec:7,Oblique (\textsc{obl)\label{sec:7.9,,,"The \textsc{oblique} case, marked by the absence of any suffix, is the ‘leftover’ case. As such, it is employed to mark nouns in a variety of disparate grammatical roles and functions. Among these are the following: 1) The subject and/or object of an \isi{imperative} clause, 2) the subject and/or object of an optative clause, 3) the object of a \isi{preposition}, and 4) a vocative noun (used when calling someone). Each of these uses of the \isi{oblique case} are demonstrated in examples \REF{ex:case:42}-\REF{ex:case:46}:\\",ex:case:42,\gll Deté bi cue=dííǃ | \gls bring:IMP you:OBL water:OBL=those | \glt ‘You bring that water!’,ex:case:46,"\gll Éé wice, atsúǃ | \gls hey children:OBL come:IMP | \glt ‘Hey children, come!’",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

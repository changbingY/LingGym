Introduction,The Mauwake language,Typological overview of morphological and syntactic features,Mauwake as a Trans New Guinea language,,"Mauwake is clearly a nominative-accusative type language, rather than ergative-\linebreak absolutive. The agent of a transitive verb \REF{ex:1:x1523} is marked in the same way as the actor of an intransitive verb \REF{ex:1:x1524}, and most experiential verbs have the experiencer as a nominative subject \REF{ex:1:x1525}.",ex:1:x1523,\gll Yo mauw-owa nia asip-i-yem. | \gls 1s.UNM work-NMZ 2p.ACC help-NP-PR.1s | \glt  `I help you with work.',ex:1:x1524,\gll Yo koka=pa ik-e-m. | \gls 1s.UNM jungle=LOC be-PA-1s | \glt  `I was in the jungle.',ex:1:x1525,"\gll Yo wuailal-i-yem a. | \gls 1s.UNM hunger-NP-PR.1s oh | \glt  `Oh, I'm hungry.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Introduction,The Mauwake language,Typological overview of morphological and syntactic features,Mauwake as a Trans New Guinea language,,"\textstyleEmphasizedWords{{Verb morphology}} in Mauwake is extensive, even if not as extensive and complex as in some other Papuan languages. The morphology is agglutinative, and affixation is mostly very transparent. Suffixes are used for subject, tense and aspect, benefactive, distributive, causative and counterfactual marking. Prefixing is used very little, only for reduplication and to form verbs referring to bringing and taking. It is possible to have several derivational and inflectional affixes in one verb, as shown by the elicited example \REF{ex:1:x664}, but in actual usage this is rare.",ex:1:x664,\gll Muuka wia \textbf{arim-ow-omak-om-ek-a-k}. | \gls son 3p.ACC grow-CAUS-DISTR/PL-BEN-BNFY1.\TEXTSC{CNTF-pa}-3s | \glt  `(S)he would have brought up (many) sons for me.',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Introduction,The Mauwake language,Typological overview of morphological and syntactic features,Mauwake as a Trans New Guinea language,,"A very typical feature in Papuan languages is a difference between final (\sectref{sec:3.8.3.4}) and medial verbs (\sectref{sec:3.8.3.5}). The former are finite verbs with full inflection for tense and subject number and person, and the most typical position for them is at the end of a declarative sentence. The medial verbs indicate whether the subject of a clause is the same as \REF{ex:1:x662}, or different from \REF{ex:1:x663}, that of the following clause. The same-subject forms also indicate whether the action of the second verb is simultaneous with that of the first verb, or sequential \REF{ex:1:x662} in relation to it. Medial clauses (\sectref{sec:8.2}) are coordinate with, but also dependent on, the following clause. Because of the existence and extensive use of medial clauses, temporal subordinate clauses (\sectref{sec:8.3.3.1}) are used very little in Mauwake.\footnote{Medial clauses in Papuan languages are often translated with temporal subordinate clauses in other languages, even if they are not subordinate in the original language.}",ex:1:x662,"\gll Owowa or-\textbf{op}, wuailal-\textbf{ep} akia ik-e-k. | \gls village go-SS.SEQ be.hungry-SS.SEQ banana roast-PA-3s | \glt  `He went to the village, was hungry and roasted bananas.'",ex:1:x663,"\gll Mik-\textbf{amkun} me um-o-k, wiowa onaiya ikiw-em-ik-\textbf{eya}.

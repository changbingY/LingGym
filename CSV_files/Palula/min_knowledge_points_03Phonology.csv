Phonology,Consonants,Distribution and variation,,,"There is also a~less consistent neutralisation of the contrast between aspirated dental (\ref{ex:3-1}) and retroflex voiceless (\ref{ex:3-2}) affricates and their fricative counterparts (but as far as I have been able to observe, never between aspirated voiceless palatal affricates and fricatives), apparently limited to certain lexical items.",ex:3-1,Not found,ex:3-2,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Phonology,Consonants,Distribution and variation,,,"The case is a~little more complicated with the retroflex nasal, /ɳ/. Although it is clear in some cases that retroflexion is the result of assimilation with an~adjacent retroflex consonant, this cannot always be concluded. Whereas a~retroflex nasal normally does not occur word initially (although the word /ɳiɳeː/ (ṇiṇeé) `popcorn' can be cited as an~isolated counterexample), it contrasts intervocalically with dental /n/, compare /deːni/ and /deːɳi/ in (\ref{ex:3-3}), and word""=finally, /kan/ and /kaɳ/ in (\ref{ex:3-4}).",ex:3-3,Not found,ex:3-4,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Phonology,Vowels,Vowel neutralisation,,,"Whereas B maintains a~word""=final /a/ vs. /e/ contrast~-- as is clearly evidenced in the morphological contrast between the general oblique inflection -a, as in /ˈdiːɕa/ `in the village', and the genitive singular -e, as in /ˈdiːɕe/ `of the village', of many masculine nouns~-- there is no evidence of contrast between these two unaccented short vowels in A (where the unaccented genitive ending instead is /iː/). In contrast, a~non""=variable masculine ending [u] in B, corresponds to two different (but grammatically identical) masculine endings [o] and [u] in A. Curiously, the realisations of these two variants are in complementary distribution, although there is no obvious phonological motivation behind it. When preceded by /aː/ (in the previous syllable), the allophone is [u], while it is [o] when preceded by any other vowel, as can be seen in (\ref{ex:3-7}).",ex:3-7,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Phonology,Vowels,The status of diphthongs,,,"The sequences of vowels in lexical stems all consist of at least one close vowel (also interpretable as an~approximant), such as [ai], [aːi], [ui], [oːi], [oi], [eːi], [ueː], [uaː], [iaː], [ioː], [aːu], [au]. Probably most, if not all, combinations of a~short close vowel and another long or short vowel are possible. Some examples are given in (\ref{ex:3-8}).",ex:3-8,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Phonology,Phonotactics,Syllable structure,,,"A typical syllable in Palula is an~open syllable consisting of a~consonant and a~vowel. This is the most common type when the syllable is unaccented. Long, as well as short vowels (\ref{ex:3-9}) could constitute the nucleus of such a~syllable: CV or CVV. There are monosyllabic words (/be/, /wiː/) which conform to this basic CV pattern, but most words are polysyllabic, consisting of two or more CV (or CVV) syllables (such as /ɡuː.li/ and /ku.ɳaː.koː.miː/).",ex:3-9,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Phonology,Phonotactics,Syllable structure,,,"The closed""=syllable pattern, CV(V)C, is also a~very common syllable, see examples in (\ref{ex:3-10}), and the most common one in accented syllables. This type occurs in monosyllabic as well as in polysyllabic words. Commonly, however, a~word is made up of a~combination of open and closed syllables.",ex:3-10,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Phonology,Phonotactics,Syllable structure,,,"Even onsetless syllables, V(C) or VV(C), occur in Palula (\ref{ex:3-11}), though less frequently. That means that both the onset and the coda is optional, i.e., a~vowel nucleus can occur alone or at least word""=initially. Whether this is also possible word""=medially or word""=finally is an~interpretational issue, but in any case, there are no single phonological words consisting of only a~vowel nucleus.\footnote{An alternative analysis not attempted in this work would be to regard a~glottal stop as a~consonant phoneme preceding all vowels that are here considered word""=initial, thus doing away with onsetless syllables altogether.}",ex:3-11,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Phonology,Phonotactics,Consonant clusters,,,"There is a~maximum onset of three consonants in Palula words, as can be seen in (\ref{ex:3-12}). These are clusters of voiced consonants only, whose third member always is /h/ (phonetically realised as [ɦ]). One type, whose middle member is /r/ preceded by a plosive, go back to old (or secondarily formed) voiced aspirates followed by /r/. The aspirates have been reinterpreted as plosive + /h/ clusters, and a subsequent realignment has taken place, whereby the more sonorant /h/ has changed to the position closest to the syllable nucleus: /brhoː/ `brother' < */bhraː/ < \textit{bhr\'{\={a}}tr̥-}. Another type, whose middle member is one of the two approximants /j/ or /w/ (if we go with the analysis presented above, \sectref{subsec:3-2-3}) preceded by a plosive or a nasal, have arisen through de""=syllabification of a short unaccented closed vowel, in some cases subsequent to vowel metathesis, such as is the case (in A) with /ɡwheːɳiː/ `Pashtun' (< /ɡhweːɳiː/ < /ɡhueːɳiː/ < /uɡheːɳiː/, the latter which is still the form heard in the conservative B dialect). That other clusters similar to the last-mentioned type seem to be in the process of evolving is evidenced by co-existing forms: /ukʰaːndu/\sim/kʰwaːndu/ (ukháandu) `is coming/going up \textsc{msg}', perhaps pointing to a~preference for Cw and Cj clusters vis-à-vis word initial V-syllables.",ex:3-12,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Phonology,Phonotactics,Consonant clusters,,,"Initial two""=consonant clusters, see (\ref{ex:3-13}), share many of the features already mentioned for three""=consonant onsets. The second member of such a~cluster is either /r/ (most of them of considerable age), an~approximant (with a recent history, derived along the same lines as was presented above for /ɡwheːɳiː/), or /h/ (which is either historical voiced aspiration reinterpreted as a cluster, or a new initial cluster arisen through laryngeal metathesis). Usually, but not exclusively, /r/ is preceded by a~plosive (in the majority of cases a voiceless one). Voiceless aspirated plosives in clusters with /r/ are rare indeed, the verb /pʰrajaːnu/ `send' is the only example found so far in the data with a following /r/. Approximant may be preceded by plosive, fricatives or nasals. Nearly any voiced consonant may precede /h/ in initial clusters (the only exceptions in the data being the ""new"" phoneme /ɣ/, and the distributionally limited consonants /ɳ/ and /ɽ/).",ex:3-13,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Phonology,Phonotactics,Consonant clusters,,,"Two""=consonant clusters in coda position, see (\ref{ex:3-14}), seem to be subject to a~much higher degree of variability, although the position also seems to be slightly more permissive than the onset.

Phonology,Phonotactics,Consonant clusters,,,"A special case is the final cluster /ndr/ in /jaːndr/, see (\ref{ex:3-15}). This is the only three""=consonant cluster at a~word boundary discovered so far, but its exact phonetic realisation is not entirely easy to define in terms of segments. With some speakers, the /n/ is clearly articulated, whereas the /dr/ part is only faintly present, and in other pronunciations the final /r/ gets a~schwa""=like sound attached to it, in practice making /dr/ the onset of an~additional syllable. As with the above""=mentioned clusters occurring at the end of singular nouns, the same cluster stretching over a~syllable boundary in an~inflected form of the same noun is clearly and unambiguously articulated: /jaːn.dra/ `mills'.",ex:3-15,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Phonology,Phonotactics,Consonant clusters,,,"Clusters occurring in syllable onsets and syllable codas intervocalically, see (\ref{ex:3-16}), are subject to the same restrictions as the clusters at word boundaries described above, but a few of them, particularly those containing /h/, are extremely rare in that position.",ex:3-16,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Phonology,Phonotactics,Consonant clusters,,,"Apart from those, a number of other consonant clusters not permitted at word""=boundaries are found word""=internally.

A synchronic process or rule restricting the occurrence of aspirated sounds to one per word has also been stipulated for other NIA languages (see for example \citet[32]{losey2002} for Gojri, and \citet[34--35]{shackle1976} for Siraiki).

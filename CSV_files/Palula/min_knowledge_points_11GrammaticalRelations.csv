Grammatical relations,Verb agreement,Accusative alignment,,,"In the non""=present imperfective -- Past Imperfective in (\ref{ex:11-1}) and Future in (\ref{ex:11-2}) --, the verb always agrees in person in accordance with an~accusative alignment, i.e., with the subject, whether S, as in the intransitive clause in (\ref{ex:11-1}), or A, as in the transitive clause in (\ref{ex:11-2}).",ex:11-1,Not found,ex:11-2,Not found,ex:11-1,Not found,ex:11-2,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,

Grammatical relations,NP case differentiation,Inflectional case marking,,,"As we saw in \sectref{sec:4-5}, the central case distinction made inflectionally is that between the nominative and the oblique cases. As for the relations we are interested in, the nominative is used for S, A and O alike in the non""=perfective categories, whereas in the perfective, A, as in (\ref{ex:11-10}), is singled out as coded in the oblique case (kaṭamuš-á) versus the nominatively\footnote{In the description of a~system with a~consistently ergative case alignment, this would be referred to as absolutive, a~term I prefer not to use when describing the split ergative system of Palula.} coded (kaṭamúš) S in (\ref{ex:11-8}) and O in (\ref{ex:11-9}).",ex:11-10,Not found,ex:11-8,Not found,ex:11-9,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

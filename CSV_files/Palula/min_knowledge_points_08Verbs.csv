Verbs,Complex predicates,Conjunct verbs,,,"The verb in such a~construction comes from a~small set of verb stems that I will refer to as verbalisers.

Verbs,Complex predicates,Conjunct verbs,,,"That is further achieved in an~economical way, limited strictly to only a~few inflectional paradigms. An extended advantage of this ``verbal flexibility'' is the relative ease with which entirely new verbs can be made or brought into the language, sometimes as totally novel constructions, sometimes as calques of conjunct verb constructions in languages of wider communication. This does not necessarily mean that a~new verb will be made just to fill a~gap or to replace one that is already there; instead these constructions could elaborate on or refine the meaning of other verbs. We also find, perhaps not surprisingly, a~substantial number of loan words (primarily from Urdu or Pashto) in the host slot of conjunct verbs, such as daawát and muqaabilá in (\ref{ex:8-23}).",ex:8-23,"\gll deeúl-ii xálak""=am \textbf{daawát} \textbf{dít-i} atsharíit""=am the ki \textbf{muqaabilá} \textbf{th-íia} | \gls Dir-GEN people-PL.OBL invitation give.PFV-F Ashreti-PL.OBL to that contest do-1PL | \glt `The people from Dir invited the the Ashreti people to have a competition with them.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

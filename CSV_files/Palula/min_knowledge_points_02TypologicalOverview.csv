Typological overview,Syntax,,,,"There is relatively little synchronically productive derivational morphology in the language, but a~productive process for deriving verbs from other categories from within the language as well as from entirely novel or non""=native elements is the use of verbalisers such as the- `do' and bhe- `become'.

Typological overview,Syntax,,,,"As far as alignment is concerned, Palula displays an~intricate split system. In the perfective categories (Simple Past, Perfect and Pluperfect), the pattern is essentially ergative, as seen in example (\ref{ex:2-1}), with a~non""=nominatively marked agent""=subject and verbal agreement with the feminine direct object. In the non""=perfective categories (Future, Present and Past Imperfective), in contrast, it is essentially accusative, which can be observed from the nominatively marked agent""=subject in (\ref{ex:2-2}), which is also the NP that the transitive verb agrees with in gender and number.",ex:2-1,Not found,ex:2-2,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Typological overview,Syntax,,,,"Several NP splits further complicate the picture.

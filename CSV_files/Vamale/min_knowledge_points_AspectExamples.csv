Example (\ref{ex:ja_balan}) combines balan's implication of an obstacle, with the resultative meaning of ja to imply an expected hurdle.

With meanings ranging from \qu{this has just begun/come to happen} to \qu{finally}, the common denominator of non-continuative balan is that the resulting construction is a realis one, or is so close to becoming one that it might as well already be. This is the reason why bo balan is contested (see \sectref{ssec:bo balan}); it seems to be more widely accepted by younger speakers. bwa balan ambiguously means either \qu{has recently begun and is still underway} and \qu{has practically begun}, probably both using the ambiguity of bwa as both a realis and irrealis marker (\ref{sec:bwa}), and at least originally coming from hyperbole (\qu{I'm so close to doing it that I've practically begun}). However, neither of these explanations would work with bo, which is explicitly irrealis and thus unlikely to be used here for hyperbole, as well as being unavailable for combinations with realis markers.

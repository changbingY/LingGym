Phonology,Transcription,,,,": /ᵐb/, /ⁿd/, /ⁿɟ/, /ᵑg/. This is systematic and, following the local linguistic tradition, will not be represented. Vowels are nasalized after nasals, and often also before them (this includes the pre-nasal elements in voiced plosives such as /ᵐb/, to an extent). There is also interplay with aspirated plosives for historical reasons (see \sectref{ssec:Aspiration}). Only phonemically nasal vowels will be represented as nasal, with the circumflex diacritic \ort{\^{}} used in all Northern transcription systems. Compare the representations of (\ref{ex:nasal}) with phonemic nasalization with (\ref{ex:nasal2}) with predictable aspiration.",ex:nasal,\gll wîî-n yee | \gls strength-NSPEC.POSS tree | \glt strength of a tree,ex:nasal2,\gll wii-n yee | \gls field-NSPEC.POSS tree | \glt orchard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Phonology,Transcription,,,,"True minimal pairs between oral and phonemic nasal vowels are rare, while contexts in which phonemically oral vowels are nasalized abound. The degree of nasality depends on the speaker, so the phonetic difference depicted in example (\ref{ex:nasal}) is not a representative or reliable criterion to identify phonemically nasal vowels, though the latter tend to be more strongly nasal than nasalized ones. %Since phonemic status is not always clearly determined, circumflex diacritics will also mark nasal vowels where the nasal quality is not necessarily phonologically conditioned, as for \ort{phwê} /pʰʷɛ̃/ \qu{moon} (see \sectref{ssec:Aspiration} and \sectref{ssec:NasalV}).",ex:nasal,\gll wîî-n yee | \gls strength-NSPEC.POSS tree | \glt strength of a tree,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Phonology,Transcription,,,,"Vamale speakers frequently code-switch to French.

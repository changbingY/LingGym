Verb phrases,What is a verb phrase?,,,,"A verb phrase in Vamale will be defined as the syntactic unit depending on a verb, i.e. which moves with the verb, disappears if the verb is replaced by a light verb like vwa \qu{do} or hmwaana \qu{do like this} (\ref{ex:VP}). The verb phrase includes the head verb, its subject and other arguments, and other verbs that stand in a more or less integrated relationship to the head verb, but are neither coordinated nor subordinated verb phrases. Whether TAM markers, subject indexes and other particles should count as part of the verb phrase may be debated, because they still occur with placeholder morphemes, but since the latter were treated under \Cref{ChapterVerbs} and the former are described in \Cref{ChapterAspect}, we shall concentrate on the elements to the right of the verb.

Complex clauses,,,,,"Some morphemes have both subordinating and coordinating functions, e.g. ma (\sectref{ssec:ma}, \sectref{ssec:cond_ma}), and the presence of insubordination, usually with adhortative or optative function, confronts us with matrix and subordinate clauses that look the same. Insubordinate clauses are structurally identical to subordinate clauses, with the exception that they do not depend on a matrix clause (\sectref{ssec:Insub}). Apart from complement clauses, which are unambiguous, there are cases of two subordinate clauses coordinated by a conjunction, showing that they do not occupy the same slot (ex. \ref{ex:hapi_ma} in \sectref{ssec:hapi}). Furthermore, coordinate clauses cannot be fronted (though a coordinating conjunction may be the first element of a clause), whereas some subordinate ones can.",ex:hapi_ma,\gll e=caihnan hapi ma a=bo vwa | \gls 1SG=know COMP SUBR 3SG=IRR do | \glt I know with certainty that he will do it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Complex clauses,Coordination,,,,"Coordination of clauses in Vamale holds no deep secrets. The string of clauses is articulated via elements which, in many cases, also appear in the coordination of noun and verb phrases. Both clauses maintain the same word order as single clauses.

Complex clauses,Subordination,Complementation,Modal complementizer ma,,"Modal constructions in Vamale are to a large extent formed in the same way: a matrix clause consisting of a modal word, and the proposition modified by the modal word, i.e. a complement clause. While the complement clause usually takes subject index marking, the 3\gl{sg} form a merges with the subordinator ma and is used in contexts where the subject is unknown. In (\ref{ex:comp_ma}), the modal word is the stative verb xahnang \qu{good}, which introduces the desirable proposition (\qu{if I knew what you are talking about}).",ex:comp_ma,\gll xahnang m=e bo caihna-n hapi go=pala ko i=da | \gls good COMP=1SG IRR know-ANA COMP 2SG=speak OBL DEF.SG=what | \glt It would be good if I knew what you are talking about.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The other clause cannot be added with hapi, as the latter is governed by a semantically defined group of verbs, which does not include fwajimwake. Hence we have two clauses: matrix clause e fwajimwako and matrix clause kai a i vukin-ea. i vukin-ea, a nominalized form of the stative verb vukin- \qu{to be the cause}, is the predicate of the equative clause with kai, which is itself an content of the question fwajimwa-ko, but cannot be added to the main verb.

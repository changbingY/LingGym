Undergoers would be added as oblique arguments with ko \qu{\gl{obl}}, see example (\ref{ex:vwa_ko}). Since vwa is semantically vague and thus readily used as a filler verb, new compounds are often formed (e.g. vwa toki \qu{do metal}, \qu{make a telephone call}), established compounds can broken up ad hoc into verb phrases with specific arguments (see example \ref{ex:vwa_ref}) and many remain transparent phrases.

A verb phrase can be nominalized just by putting an article in front of it, after which it functions as an argument. A noun phrase can be used as a predicate, and preceded by aspect and modality markers. As discussed by \textcite[3]{creissels_non-verbal_}, one can distinguish three types of non-verbal predicates: nominal, adjectival, and locative. Vamale has no adjectives, but nominal and locative predicates are well attested. example (\ref{ex:le_niehni}) is an example of a pronominal predicate, (\ref{ex:ca_i_bureau}) shows a predicative locative noun phrase, composed of a prepositional noun ca \qu{in} and a common noun, and a nominal predicate is shown in (\ref{ex:predN}).",ex:le_niehni,"\gll li=bee-m, le=niehni | \gls DEF.PL=peer-2SG.POSS 3PL=all.those | \glt Your friends, they are those over there.",ex:ca_i_bureau,Not found,ex:predN,\gll go=bo i=daahma | \gls 2SG=IRR DEF.SG=chief | \glt You would be chief.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subject index clitics are always present (except in imperatives, or in stative verbs with inanimate subjects). This means that, at least following the Uniqueness Condition asking for each grammatical relation to be assigned only once within its clause (after \cite[19]{kroeger_analyzing_2004}), subject indexing clitics (or ``bound pronouns"") and free personal pronouns are not allomorphs.

The clitics occur before active verbal, or nominal predicates, in the slot left of the TAM markers. The pair yo \textasciitilde e= \qu{1\gl{sg}} is the same in Cèmuhî \parencite[61]{rivierre_langue_1980}, but not in other Voh-Koné languages.

The sound correspondence [ð] \textasciitilde [j] is a regular one between coastal and mountain varieties. Note that while the bound pronouns are mostly very similar to the free pronouns, they can co-occur in the same clause (\ref{ex:subject_index}), which is a sign that they do not have the same syntactic role: the free forms are true pronouns, whereas the bound pronouns have become grammaticalized to subject indexes on predicates.% the free form ya \qu{3\gl{sg}} seems to be a loan from the Pije form nyang or Fwâi yak \qu{3\gl{sg}} \parencite[246]{haudricourt_dictionnaire_1982}.",ex:subject_index,\gll e=xale-le ka yo | \gls 1SG=see-3PL.OBJ SBJ 1SG | \glt I see them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Word classes % Main chapter title,Repetitive mwa,,,,"In (\ref{ex:movV-mwa1}) and for all other movement verbs, as well as xhose \qu{do again}, mwa is analyzed as a suffix, i.e. as having fused with its host. First, mwa assimilates to the root, which it does not do in other contexts.\footnote{Xhosepwa suggests a dropped -t or -p. The Pije and Fwâi cognates khô-peei \qu{?-say} \parencite[155]{haudricourt_dictionnaire_1982} could be a diachronic hint at a morphologically complex, old Vamale form.} Compare hut-mwa \rightarrow /hupʷa/ \qu{go back down}, to hut=mwa \qu{go down again}.",ex:movV-mwa1,"\gll go=ha-mwa-me | \gls 2SG=go=REP=DIR.CP | \glt You return to me, you come back.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Word classes % Main chapter title,Quantifiers,,,,"Quantifiers are a tiny group of particles that are not inflected, directly preceding an (article) noun construction: mu \qu{little}, jaa \qu{many} (\ref{ex:jaa}), and ju-vaa \qu{too much}, which is also attested as an intensifier in verb phrases (\ref{ex:juva}). Quantifiers denote number and are described in \sectref{ssec:Quant}. Other words have similar meanings, but are verbs, like hmai- \qu{many}. One quantifier similarly integrates the noun phrase, but bears possessive suffixes: meeka-n \qu{all}.",ex:jaa,\gll ja apuli canbwen | \gls many people yesterday | \glt (there were) more people yesterday (than now),ex:juva,\gll ju-vaa apuli | \gls too.much person | \glt too many people,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Phonology,Diphthongs\label{sec:2.2,,,,The difference between diphthongs and \isi{vowels} in \isi{hiatus} is not always straightforward. A spontaneous production of /piun/ `lard' with /i/ and /u/ in \isi{hiatus} is found in (\ref{ex:lard}).,ex:lard,\gll La mùm' ò méz ajn \textbf{piún}. | \gls DEF.F.SG mother have.PRS.3SG put.PTCP.UNM into lard.M.SG | \glt `Mother added some lard.',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Phonology,Diphthongs\label{sec:2.2,,,,"Hiatus across word boundaries is usually avoided. There are two strategies. The first and generally used one is the elision of the last vowel of the first word if it is a weak vowel (ə and ɐ, both spelled <a>), as in \textit{Quaj \textbf{vèz' ò} uschéja} `This looks like that' instead of vèza ò. Example (\ref{ex:sandhi1}) contains two examples of the weak vowel <a> which is elided (bigj' idéa for bigja idéa and stad' ajn for stada ajn), a well as one example of strong \isi{vowels} that do not trigger elision (ju èra).",ex:sandhi1,"\gll Núa ṣè quaj hòtè̱l? \textbf{Bigj'} \textbf{idéa}, \textbf{ju} \textbf{èra} schòn ònṣ bigja \textbf{stad’} \textbf{ajn} quaj martgau. | \gls where COP.PRS.3SG DEM.M.SG hotel NEG idea 1SG be.IMPF.1SG already year.M.PL NEG COP.PTCP.F.SG in DEM.M.SG city | \glt `Where is this hotel?

Phonology,Diphthongs\label{sec:2.2,,,,"The other, much less frequent strategy, is to insert an \isi{epenthetic n} between the two words as in (\ref{ex:euphonic1}), where n is inserted between vasèva and ins.",ex:euphonic1,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Phonology,Consonants\label{sec:2.3,,,,"There are some cases of assimilation of \isi{consonants} across word boundaries. In (\ref{ex:ass1}), détg di `said to' is realised as [detːi], and in (\ref{ex:ass2}), détg: té `said: you' is pronounced [detːe].",ex:ass1,Not found,ex:ass2,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Phonology,Consonants\label{sec:2.3,,,,"A major problem in analysing \isi{consonants} is the question whether the \isi{voiceless} word final \isi{consonants} should be considered as such or as underlyingly voiced. For instance, in \ili{Standard Sursilvan} the 1st person singular \isi{conditional} is written cantass `I would sing', but in Tuatschin when followed by a vowel or a voiced consonant, it is pronounced /z/, as in stèṣ /ʃtɛz/ (\ref{ex:stes}).",ex:stes,"\gll [...] álṣò sch' ju \textit{\textbf{stèṣ}} aun fá in' jèda quaj, \textit{\textbf{figès}} ju bétga. | \gls … well if 1SG must.COND.1SG still do.INF one.F.SG time DEM.UNM do.COND.1SG 1SG NEG | \glt `[...] well, if I had to do it once more, I wouldn'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

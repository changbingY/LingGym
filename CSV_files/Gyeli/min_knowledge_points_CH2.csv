Phonology,Consonants,Consonant clusters,Labialization and palatalization,,"It turns out, however, that in Gyeli this is not the case. \REF{bwn} lists noun stems that start with /bw/, providing examples of different vowel heights. These examples contrast with \REF{bn} where /b/ is not labialized and followed by the same vowels. Therefore, labialization cannot be a phonological process that is determined by the consonant's phonological environment. Just like most NC sequences, I consider labialized and palatalized obstruents as consonant clusters rather than single phonemic units. This analysis is based on the fact that both consonants in the sequence can occur as independent phonemes on their own as well as their distributional restriction to the first syllable. In this way, they are similar to the other consonant clusters, namely the nasal + obstruent clusters discussed in \sectref{sec:Prenasa} and the consonant-fricative clusters described in \sectref{sec:Affricates}. Therefore, and because (other) consonant clusters are not to be expected from a historical and language family perspective, I do not see any reasons to treat labialized and palatalized consonants differently from other consonant clusters in the language, for instance proposing secondary articulation.\footnote{Another possible analysis would be to assume a third category of complex consonants, in contrast to simple consonants and consonant clusters, as \citet{guldemann2001} proposes for !Xõo. While this is an elegant solution for !Xõo, it does not seem to have any advantage in describing Gyeli synchronically.

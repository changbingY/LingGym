The noun phrase,Introduction,,,,"Simple noun phrases include pronouns (\sectref{sec:PRO}). Pronouns can occur bare in all types of noun phrases: subject, object, and oblique.

The noun phrase,Introduction,,,,"Simple noun phrases also consist of bare nouns.\footnote{A detailed discussion of how referents of bare nouns in Gyeli are tracked is provided in \citeauthor{grimmforthb} (To appear).} Gyeli does not have articles and bare nouns can occur in subject, object, and oblique noun phrases. Bare nouns can combine in simple noun phrases with elements discussed in \sectref{sec:NAdjuncts}. Gyeli is a head-initial language and almost all modifiers, both agreeing and invariable, follow the noun. There are two exceptions, however: the negative polarity item {\itshape tɔ̀} `any' (\sectref{sec:InvQUANT1} and {\itshape nyá} `big' always precede the noun. If a simple noun phrase includes more than one postnominal modifier, the order of the modifiers is freely variable,\footnote{It may be that a change in order results in a slightly different reading in terms of emphasis on one or the other modifier, but this was not clear from my data.} and there does not seem to be a particular modifier that is closer to the noun than others. The reason for this could be that multiple modifiers in simple noun phrases are highly dispreferred. Tests on modifier combinations in a simple noun phrase all stem from grammaticality judgment tests in elicitations. In natural texts, however, the only instance were two modifiers where combined in a noun phrase is given in \REF{protemp2}.",protemp2,\gsrc bèsâ bíndɛ̀ byɛ́sɛ̀ | \gll be-sâ bí-ndɛ̀ by-ɛ́sɛ̀ | \gls be8-thing 8-ANA 8-all | \glt `all these things',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

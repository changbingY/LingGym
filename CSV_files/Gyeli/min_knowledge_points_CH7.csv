Simple clauses,,,,,"Gyeli has copula clauses with both non-verbal and verbal copula constructions. They are typically comprised of a subject, a copula, and a predicate, which is sometimes called a ``copula complement''. There are copula forms in some languages, such as {\itshape ni} in Swahili in \REF{John1}, which are clearly non-verbal as they do not inflect for person, tense, aspect, or mood. In this construction, {\itshape John} is the subject, {\itshape ni} the copula, and {\itshape mkubwa} `big' the predicate.",John1,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Another argument for organizing non-verbal and verbal copulas within the same clause type is that the choice of either one in Gyeli often depends on the tense, aspect, mood, and polarity category of the clause. In \REF{banana1}, a non-verbal copula is used in the present, whereas a verbal copula, an inflected form of {\itshape bɛ̀} `be', has to be used in \REF{banana2} for its negated version and in \REF{banana3} for the past.",John1,Not found,John,Not found,banana1,\gsrc lènjù \textbf{léè} nábèbè | \gll le-njù léè nábèbè | \gls le5-banana 5.COP red | \glt `The banana is red.',banana2,\gsrc lènjù \textbf{lé} \textbf{bɛ́lɛ́} nábèbè | \gll le-njù le-H bɛ̀-lɛ nábèbè | \gls le5-banana 5-PRS be-NEG red | \glt `The banana is not red.',banana3,\gsrc lènjù \textbf{lè} \textbf{bɛ́} nábèbè | \gll le-njù le bɛ̀-H nábèbè | \gls le5-banana 5.PST1 be-R red | \glt `The banana was red.',,,,,,,,,,

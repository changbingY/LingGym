Preliminaries,Typological overview\label{Typoverview,Morphology,,,"Nominal morphology in Komnzo is comparatively simple. Case marking is shown by enclitics that attach to the rightmost element of a noun phrase, which is usually a head noun as in (\ref{exintro2}), but may sometimes be a modifier as in (\ref{exintro3}).",exintro2,\ex | \gll kafar kabe=f=nzo. | \gls big man=ERG.SG=ONLY. | \glt `only the big man (did sth.)',exintro3,\ex | \gll kabe kafar=f=nzo. | \gls man big=ERG.SG=ONLY. | \glt `only the big man (did sth.)',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Preliminaries,Typological overview\label{Typoverview,Syntax,,,"Subordinate clauses in Komnzo are usually non-finite employing nominalised verbs with appropriate \isi{case} markers. Verb chaining and the distinction between medial and final verb forms, which are typical for Papuan languages, are not found in Komnzo.

Preliminaries,The Farem people and their language\label{faremlang,Location\label{location,,,"Komnzo is spoken in the village of Rouku, which is located about 7km west of Morehead and about a kilometer north of the Morehead River. It is situated on the road that connects Morehead with Weam in the west. Traditional lands expand about 20km east-west and 25km north-south. There are four clans in Rouku village: Mrzar Mayawa, Banibani Mayawa, Muthrata Sangara, Wazu Sangara.\footnote{Mary Ayres avoids using the word `clan' (\citeyear[142]{Ayres:ws}), instead she draws a distinction between ``non-local sections'' (Bagu, Mayawa, Sagara), which are found throughout the region, and ``local-sections'' (Nümgar Bagu, Mrzar Mayawa, Muthrata Sangara), which are found in one group only, for example the Farem. I will use `clan' for the latter and `section' for the former. This is discussed in \S\ref{exogamy}.} Further settlements include Morehead, Gunana, Firra, Kanathr, Ŋazäthe and Masu. Only Morehead and Gunana are settled permanently, while the others are garden places in some years. The map in Figure \ref{fig-01-ROUKUmap} shows Rouku and the surrounding places.",exogamy,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Tense, aspect and mood \label{TAMpalooza",The combinatorics of TAM \label{combitam,The prefix series \label{tamprefixseries,,,"A second explanation is a true difference in meaning. Although \Betaone{} and \Betatwo{} are almost always interchangeable without a clear change in meaning, there are some hints that semantics may play a role. For example, the \isi{copula} can only take \Betatwo{} and not \Betaone{}, and the same is true for the verb yak `walk' (\ref{ex280}). Only when the \isi{copula} is used in an ambifixing template, both \Betaone{} and \Betatwo{} are possible. However, in an ambifixing template the copula cannot be translated as `be', but instead functions as a \isi{light verb} with the meaning `do'. For other verbs, \Betaone{} and \Betatwo{} are interchangeable. This observation leads me to believe that the \Betatwo{} prefixes encode either a longer duration of the event or a greater degree of affectedness of the participants. However, targeted elicitation and close observation of natural texts did not lead to a clear pattern along these lines. Informants found it hard to give a characterisation or translation of the difference and often contradicted each other or themselves.

"Tense, aspect and mood \label{TAMpalooza",Some remarks on the semantics of TAM\label{TAMsemantics,Aspect\label{TAMsemaspect,,,"Traditional accounts of perfectivity often take the completion of an event as a starting point (\citealt[296]{Frawley:1992wi}) or suggests that ``perfectivity indicates the view of a situation as a single whole'' (\citealt[16]{Comrie:1976vd}). In Komnzo, completion does not really play a role in the semantics of the perfective-\isi{imperfective} distinction. The boundary set up by the \isi{perfective} seems to concentrate more on the left edge, i.e. on the beginning of the event. Similar systems are found elsewhere in the Southern New Guinea region, for example in \ili{Marind} (\citealt[41]{Drabbe:1955tm}), \ili{Nama} (\citealt{Siegel:2015bp}) and \ili{Nen} (\citealt{Evans:2015wy}). In Komnzo, the main mechanism for expressing event completion, i.e. to set up a right edge event boundary, is the \isi{iamitive} \isi{particle}, which can occur with verb forms in \isi{perfective}, \isi{imperfective} and \isi{durative} \isi{aspect} ({\S}\ref{iamitivez}). It follows that imperfectivity does not entail that the event is open-ended. Example (\ref{ex370}) is taken from a head hunting story. The \isi{quantifier} bramöwä `all' signals that the attack was full-scale and all inhabitants were killed, but the verb form in (\ref{ex370}) is in the \isi{imperfective}.",ex370,"\gsrc watik ebar kabe ane fof thäthora fof ... bramöwä ane fof \textbf{efnzath}} | \gll watik ebar kabe ane fof th-ä-thor-a fof ... bramöwä ane fof e-fn-nz-a-th. | \gls then head man DEM EMPH STNSG.GAM-NDU-arrive.RS-PST EMPH ... all DEM EMPH STNSG.ALPH-hit.EXT-NDU-PST-STNSG. | \glt `Then, the head hunter arrived.

The degree to which an event is ``stretched out'' would then decide whether the speaker chooses the \isi{imperfective} or \isi{durative} \isi{aspect}. The basic binary distinction is clearest in the \isi{imperative} forms. The \isi{imperfective} imperatives often encode an ongoing action and, depending on the context, they can be translated as ``keep on X-ing'' or ``do X for some time''. Perfective imperatives, on the other hand, express inception ``start X-ing'' or punctuality ``do X once/quickly''. In example (\ref{ex373}), the speaker has just produced a toy bullroarer from a coconut leaf and shows me how to hold it properly. In (\ref{ex372}), she tells me not to hit anything while swinging, and the \isi{imperative} of `hit' is in the \isi{perfective}.\footnote{This is a conditional construction which frequently employs imperative inflections together with fthé `when/if' ({\S}\ref{TAMsemmood} and \S\ref{condiclauses}).} In (\ref{ex371}), she is already swinging the bullroarer, telling me to hold it away from the body. Consequently, all the \isi{imperative} verb forms (`hold', `blow', and `swing') are in the \isi{imperfective}.",ex373,Not found,ex372,"\gsrc fthé \textbf{sakwr} gwonyamen o festhen o wämnen ... keke kwa sranor. | \gll fthé s-a-kwr-∅ gwonyame=n o festh=en o wämne=n ... keke kwa s-ra-nor. | \gls when TSG.MASC.ALPH-NDU-hit.RS-SSG.IMP clothes=LOC or body=LOC or tree=LOC ...

"Tense, aspect and mood \label{TAMpalooza",Some remarks on the semantics of TAM\label{TAMsemantics,Mood\label{TAMsemmood,,,"Imperatives can be used in a number of ways that fall outside the definition of `giving an order'. In example (\ref{ex318}), the speaker showed me the leaves of a pandanus plant pointing out that I can use the leaves to sleep on. The \isi{imperative} form gnyaké `you go' is thus not a command `go without a mat', but more like a conditional `if you go without a mat'. The conditional interpretation also comes from the word fthé which means `when' or `at the time when'. This type of conditional construction is an extended use of the \isi{imperative} inflection. Most imperatives are used as commands, and there are conditional constructions without \isi{imperative} inflections.",ex318,"\gsrc yamemäre fthé \textbf{gnyaké} ... etfthar. | \gll yame=märe fthé gn-yak-é ... etfth=r. | \gls mat=PRIV when STSG.BET-walk.EXT.NDU-IMP ... sleep=PURP. | \glt `If you go without a mat, (this one is) for sleeping.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Tense, aspect and mood \label{TAMpalooza",Some remarks on the semantics of TAM\label{TAMsemantics,Mood\label{TAMsemmood,,,"As we have seen in {\S}\ref{irrealisra}, the irrealis is marked by the prefix ra-. There is no \isi{realis} marker, hence no realis inflection. Beyond counterfactuality and futurity, the \isi{irrealis} \isi{mood} has a number of semantic extensions in Komnzo. Cross-linguistically \isi{irrealis} \isi{mood} is employed for a wide range of functions, which has led some authors to challenge its validity as a comparative category (\citealt{Bybee:irrealis}). Others have suggested a prototype approach to \isi{irrealis} \isi{mood}, for example Givon (\citeyear[327]{Givon:1994ko}). I will adopt the latter here. Example (\ref{ex381}) and (\ref{ex382}) show the \isi{irrealis} \isi{mood} in its more central functions, counterfactuality and futurity, respectively. Examples (\ref{ex381}) is taken from a headhunting story which involved the speaker's father.\footnote{The example also shows the `relative use' of the immediate past. Although the events in the story happened a long time ago, the speaker uses the immediate past (niyamnzrm `He was staying just before') to emphasise that the headhunt took place just after his father had left the village.} Example (\ref{ex382}) is taken from a procedural in which the speaker shows me how to make a toy from a coconut leaf.",ex381,"\gsrc fi fthé niyamnzrm nafäsü kwa \textbf{thräkwrth}. | \gll fi fthé n=y-a-m-nzr-m nafä=sü kwa th-rä-kwr-th. | \gls Third.ABS when IMMpst=TSG.MASC.ALPH-VC.-sit.EXT-NDU-DUR ThirdASSOC.Pl=ETC FUT STSG.BET-IRR.NDU-hit.RS-STNSG. | \glt `If he had stayed, they would have killed him with all the others.'",ex382,\gsrc katan kwa \textbf{sräfiyothé} ... kafar minzü yé. | \gll katan kwa s-rä-fiyoth-é ... kafar minzü yé. | \gls small FUT TSG.MASC.BET-VC..NDU-make.RS-FSG ... big very TSG.MASC.COP.NDU. | \glt `I will make it smaller.

This use, especially with past habituals, has been noticed in a cross-linguistic study by Cristofaro (\citeyear{Cristofaro:2004wi}). Example (\ref{ex426}) comes from a procedural about poison-root fishing, which is a common activity during the dry season when the water recedes. The speaker talks about the preparations and the process of poison-root fishing, while his family is busy fishing in the background.

"Tense, aspect and mood \label{TAMpalooza",Some remarks on the semantics of TAM\label{TAMsemantics,Mood\label{TAMsemmood,,,"Ir\isi{realis} \isi{mood} is frequently used in narratives which report factual truths. Foley (\citeyear[389]{Foley:2000uh}) points out that Papuan languages often employ the realis-irrealis distinction for pragmatic purposes. In Komnzo, the pragmatic use comes from the alternation between \isi{irrealis} and \isi{realis} inflections especially in event sequencing. In this pattern, the \isi{irrealis} is used for backgrounding. Example (\ref{ex377}) is taken from a hunting story that occured many years ago. The story is told from a first-person perspective, thus, there is no reason to question the factual truth of what is being told. The clauses in (\ref{ex377}) describe a sequence of events: fall asleep > be sleeping > wake up. Only the foregrounded clause (`sleep') is expressed in \isi{realis} (\isi{past} \isi{durative}), whereas the \isi{backgrounded} clauses (`fall asleep' and `wake up') are expressed in \isi{irrealis} (\isi{perfective}). In that sense, the \isi{irrealis} verb forms act as a backgrounding bracket around the foregrounded clause.\footnote{Note that example (\ref{ex668}) on page \pageref{ex668} employs the same bracket-like use of the irrealis inflected verb forms. The only difference is that in (\ref{ex668}), the foregrounded event is in the non-past, whereas in (\ref{ex377}) the foregrounded event is in past durative.}",ex377,\gsrc \textbf{krämnzeré} efoth etfth \textbf{kwofrugrm} e zizi ... \textbf{krebnafé}. | \gll k-rä-mnzer-é efoth etfth kwof-rugr-m e zizi ... k-rä-bnaf-é. | \gls M.BET-IRR.VC..NDU-fall.asleep.RS-FSG sun sleep FSG.Betatwo-sleep.EXT.NDU-DUR until afternoon ...

Information structure \label{cha:infostructure,Fronted relative clauses \label{info-cleft,,,,"Relative clauses are right-adjoined ({\S}\ref{relclauses}), and an example of a \isi{relative clause} is given in (\ref{ex483}). The matrix noun phrase b√§ne dgwr `that orchid' is followed by the \isi{relative clause} [in square brackets]. Usually the \isi{relative clause} follows the matrix clause.",ex483,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Information structure \label{cha:infostructure,Fronted relative clauses \label{info-cleft,,,,"In public speeches, one often hears \isi{topic} constructions such as (\ref{ex133}) where the speaker proclaims to the people gathered at a feast that it is time to sing and dance (and not to fight). Literally, this sentence can be translated as: `The drums which resonate, they resonate for the dance ... only for this.' Formally, this is a fronted noun phrase with a following \isi{relative clause}. In most cases, the following \isi{relative clause} consists of mane `what, which' and the \isi{copula} (\ref{ex717}). As a convention, I translate this with the \ili{English} phrases `as for X', `concerning X' or `when it comes to X'.",ex133,Not found,ex717,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Information structure \label{cha:infostructure,Fronted relative clauses \label{info-cleft,,,,"As we see in (\ref{ex717}), the \isi{relative clause} often contains the \isi{copula} (lit. `Komnzo language which is ...'). The result is that it contributes nothing to the state of affairs, but its main function is pragmatic. Therefore, I analyse the fronted noun phrase together with the \isi{relative clause} under the label fronted \isi{relative clause}, i.e. fronted with respect to the matrix clause, and I put both together in bracket in the following examples. Note that there may also be no matrix noun phrase in cases where it is the event that is topicalised, for example in (\ref{ex718}).",ex717,Not found,ex718,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Information structure \label{cha:infostructure,Fronted relative clauses \label{info-cleft,,,,"Fronted relative clauses are the main strategy to introduce or reactivate topics in the sense described by Keenan and Schieffelin (\citeyear[342]{Keenan:1976wo}). We find them not only in public speeches, but also in narratives, where speakers employ them to indicate a change in \isi{topic} or to introduce a \isi{topic}. I will describe this function by taking the reader through a particular narrative. Example sentence (\ref{ex134}) introduces the protagonist of the story, a man named Kukufia.",ex134,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Information structure \label{cha:infostructure,Fronted relative clauses \label{info-cleft,,,,"Kukufia is a malicious character who comes to Rouku and tortures two children while their parents are away at a sago camp. Kukufia takes the two children fishing in his canoe. He pokes the small boy with the bones of a fish. One day, the father of the two children returns looking for them. Example (\ref{ex135}) shows, how this change in \isi{topic} is expressed.",ex135,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Information structure \label{cha:infostructure,Fronted relative clauses \label{info-cleft,,,,"Again, the change in \isi{topic} is marked by a fronted \isi{relative clause} (\ref{ex135b}). The construction is not purely pragmatic here, as there is a \isi{venitive} marker on the copula (\emph{ya\uline{n}ra}) which indicates that the father is coming.",ex135b,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Information structure \label{cha:infostructure,Fronted relative clauses \label{info-cleft,,,,"Further along in the story, the father finds his children locked inside the house. He finds out about Kukufia's visits and decides to hide underneath the house. When Kukufia returns later in the day, the father shoots him with an arrow. Kukufia runs away to Masu where his two wifes live. The father follows the trail of blood. In Masu, Kukufia transforms into a little baby boy hanging on the breast of one the wives. This is the point in the text where we find the next fronted \isi{relative clause} (\ref{ex137b}).",ex137b,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Information structure \label{cha:infostructure,Fronted relative clauses \label{info-cleft,,,,The narrator first describes Kukufia's escape in (\ref{ex137a}) and then changes the \isi{topic} to the wife on whose breast the little baby boy is hanging (\ref{ex137b}). The new \isi{topic} is again introduced by a fronted \isi{relative clause}. Kukufia's fate is sealed as the father quickly recognises the small boy. He kills Kukufia and his two wives on the spot and the story ends.,ex137a,Not found,ex137b,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Information structure \label{cha:infostructure,Fronted relative clauses \label{info-cleft,,,,"Fronted relative clauses of this type are used both to topicalise an expression, as in the introductory example to this section (\ref{ex133}), but also to indicate a change in the \isi{topic}, as in the examples above. The relative \isi{pronoun} used for this type of construction is always mane `who, which'.",ex133,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aspects of the lexicon \label{cha:lexicon,Sign metonymies\label{redupmeton,Overview,,,"In the cases involving \isi{reduplication}, there is a clear direction from base > \isi{reduplication}. In such cases, we may ask if there are any detectable patterns in the direction of the semantic extensions. Most examples follow the animacy hierarchy in the way that what ranks higher is the base and what ranks lower is the reduplicated form. A list of examples is given in the following sections. For now, we can list the züm `centipede', which reduplicates to zümzüm `grass species' (\ref{ex615}), or kwazür `fish species', which reduplicates to kwazürkwazür `grass species' (\ref{ex632}), or zuaku `widow(er)', which reduplicates to zuakuzuaku `Fly River Anchovy' (\ref{ex642}). Those examples which violate this rule involve \isi{inanimate} referents, like karo `anthill' and karokaro `grassland goana' (\ref{ex636}). Some of them can be explained by invoking relative salience or importance in every-day life.",ex615,Not found,ex632,Not found,ex642,Not found,ex636,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aspects of the lexicon \label{cha:lexicon,Sign metonymies\label{redupmeton,Conclusion\label{redupconcl,,,"This has been a preliminary analysis of the data on sign metonymies. Many examples have been collected, but more comparative data is needed to explain the semantic links. Data from the surrounding languages can provide two kinds of evidence; first, there will be more cases in which the base comes from another language, as in (\ref{ex618}), or in the myth described above. Secondly, we may find that the same biota are linked in other languages. Two examples of this come from \ili{Wära} and \ili{Blafe}. In \ili{Wära}, the link between sugarcane and a particular grass species (\ref{ex624}) is established by the \isi{reduplication} of the non-cognate word kthko [kə̆θko]. In \ili{Blafe}, the \isi{temporal} link between the fish and the grass species (\ref{ex632}) is established by the cognate word bäwr [bæwə̆r].",ex618,Not found,ex624,Not found,ex632,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Aspects of the lexicon \label{cha:lexicon,Landscape terminology\label{landscapeterminology,Mixed place names\label{mixedplacenames,,,"This principle is rather pervasive. A quarter of recorded place names involve a word from another language. I give a few examples in (\ref{ex656}-\ref{ex658}). These are sorted according to whether the Komnzo word is the first (\ref{ex656}) or last element (\ref{ex657}). I show the \isi{place name} as a single word in most cases, because often speakers only realised their segmentability when I prompted them. This is followed by a literal \ili{English} translation of the contributing elements, after which the two languages are given. In parentheses, I provide the two words in each language. Note that I follow the Komnzo orthography here, because with the exception of \ili{Nama} there is no orthography available for these varieties. A few cases are problematic because one of the two words is identical in the contributing languages (\ref{ex658}). However, all examples designate places on Komnzo speaking territory.",ex656,Not found,ex658,Not found,ex656,Not found,ex657,Not found,ex658,Not found,,,,,,,,,,
Aspects of the lexicon \label{cha:lexicon,Landscape terminology\label{landscapeterminology,Mixed place names\label{mixedplacenames,,,"The pattern of mixed place names calls for an investigation of naming customs. However, as with most place names, the point in time when such double language names were coined is far removed. Most of my informants did not remember anyone giving a name to these places. A common response was ``we learned them from our fathers''. In fact, most informants find the idea of naming a place somewhat strange. That being said, we can still draw some conclusions about naming customs. Mixed place names differ from the monolingual, descriptive place names in one important aspect. One can imagine a gradual transition from a description to a proper name like swäri zfth `swäri base' mentioned above. With mixed place names such a transition is an unlikely scenario. Instead, a more deliberate act of coining the name has to be assumed. Note that we also find monolingual place names, where a transition from description to proper name can be ruled out on semantic grounds, for example nzarga wth (`tree species + faeces') or zäzr mnz (`lazy + house'). However, the point here is that a gradual transition is unlikely because two languages are involved, even if the name is of a more descriptive nature like (\ref{ex659}) and (\ref{ex660}). These observations authenticate the importance of place in Morehead culture, an argument that was put forward by Ayres (\citeyear{Ayres:ws}).",ex659,Not found,ex660,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Aspects of the lexicon \label{cha:lexicon,Landscape terminology\label{landscapeterminology,Social landscape\label{sociallandscape,,,"This section addresses the topic of social \isi{landscape}, by which I mean the reference system used for people in relation to space. The Komnzo terms for this domain conceptualise either pure geography or what we may call kinship-dependent geography. The importance of place in the Morehead district has been described in great detail by Mary Ayres. I sketch out the sister-exchange system only where it is relevant to the discussion. Otherwise I refer the reader to Ayres (\citeyear{Ayres:ws}) and \S\ref{exogamy}.",exogamy,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Aspects of the lexicon \label{cha:lexicon,Landscape terminology\label{landscapeterminology,Social landscape\label{sociallandscape,,,"The \isi{kinship} system gives rise to yet another, very common way of referring to people. The rules of \isi{exogamy} involve a number of factors. Some are related to place, for example identification with a particular origin place establishes an exogamous group. Some are related to the section system, for example the Mayawa section regardless of place forms an exogamous group. The section classification cross-cuts the place system, i.e. one may not marry people from the same origin place, but also not from a different place if they belong to the same section. Additionally, people who ``share a land boundary'' may not intermarry. That is to say that two individuals may not marry even if they belong to different places and different sections, if their land is adjacent. Ayres argues convincingly that locality forms the most important factor in the complicated definitions of exogamous groupings (\citeyear[{\S}5]{Ayres:ws}). If \isi{kinship} is conceptualised in terms of space, it follows that \isi{kinship} terms can be used to refer to people of a particular place. I often overheard people talking about their ngom kar `brother-in-law place' or thuft kar `in-law place'. Note that the calculations one has to make to arrive at the correct referent are rather complex. Not only does one individual normally have several brothers-in-law, but that different individuals have different in-laws. Nevertheless, such knowledge is common ground for the people of Rouku. Although I often found it difficult to identify the referent in an utterance like (\ref{ex661}), every child in Rouku could make the correct deduction without effort.",ex661,\gsrc watik kraritth bern ... sukufa ärithr \textbf{nafathufthnm} ... \textbf{nafangom karnm}. | \gll watik kra\stem{rit}th b=e\stem{rn} ... sukufa ä\stem{ri}thr nafa-thufth=nm ... nafa-ngom kar=nm. | \gls then STDU:SBJ:IRR:PFV/go.across MED=STDU:SBJ:NONPAST:IPFV/be ... tobacco STSG:SBJ>STPL:IO:NONPAST:IPFV/give Third.POSS-in.law=DAT.NSG ...

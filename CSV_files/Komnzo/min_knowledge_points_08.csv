Clausal syntax \label{cha:clausalsyntax,Negation\label{negationclause,,,,"Negation at the level of the constituent can be expressed in a number of ways. The word matak `nothing' is used to express non-existence, usually in a \isi{copula} \isi{clause}. This is shown in example (\ref{ex750}) where a man takes notice that he is alone in the village. Matak can also be used in a non-verb \isi{predication}, for example nge matak `(there were) no children'. Alternatively, any \isi{noun phrase} can be negated by using the \isi{privative} case marker =mär. This is described in \S\ref{privcase}.",ex750,\gsrc kabe matak erä nima z bramöwä kwafarkwrth. | \gll kabe matak e\stem{rä} nima z bramöwä kwa\stem{fark}wrth. | \gls people nothing STPL:SBJ:NONPAST:IPFV:COP like.this IAM all STPL:SBJ:Rpst:IPFV/set.off. | \glt `There are no people (here).

Clausal syntax \label{cha:clausalsyntax,Negation\label{negationclause,,,,"Negative indefinites expressing `none whatsoever' or `nothing at all' are constructed by adding the \isi{negator} keke to a noun phrase that includes the \isi{indefinite} marker nä. For example, nä kabe means `some man' or `someone', but kabe nä keke means `nobody at all'. Note that the \isi{indefinite} is always postposed in this construction. The same can be achieved by adding nä to an \isi{interrogative}, as in (\ref{ex765}).

Space,Distal,,,,"Bantu languages with distal ka- may differ in terms of which moods the distal ka- can combine with \citep{Botne1999}. In Fwe, the distal ka- can be used in all moods. Examples of the distal marker used in the indicative were given in (\ref{bkm:Ref431991588}) and (\ref{bkm:Ref431991716}). The distal marker can also combine with an infinitive, as in (\ref{bkm:Ref416186425}). When the distal combines with an infinitive, the infinitive prefix ku- is replaced by the distal prefix ka-.\footnote{The change from the infinitive prefix ku- to ka- when used with a distal is one of the main diagnostics that can be used to identify infinitives, both synchronically and diachronically, in verbal constructions that derive from earlier infinitive forms.

Space,Distal,,,,"In many Bantu languages, the distal ka- is interpreted as ‘to go and X’. This itive semantics is possibly the result of a grammaticalization of a verb ‘to go’, for which evidence can be found in southern Bantoid and northwestern Narrow Bantu languages \citep{Botne1999}. The development of distal markers from verbs of motion is a well-attested grammaticalization path (\citealt{HeineEtAl1993}: 103-104), and is also seen in two Tanzanian Bantu languages \citep{Nicolle2003}. The link between the distal marker and an itive interpretation is not seen in all languages, however; in Yeyi, a Bantu language geographically but not genealogically close to Fwe, the distal marker ka- is not interpreted as itive \citep{Seidel2007}. In Fwe, itive semantics do appear to form a central part of the interpretation of the distal marker ka-. This is seen in the use of the distal with imperative verbs, as in example (\ref{bkm:Ref494982220}) above, where the itive semantics ‘go and’ is contributed by the distal marker alone. Another example showing that motion is a necessary component for the use of distal ka- is illustrated in (\ref{bkm:Ref416188091}--\ref{bkm:Ref74909097}), drawn from a narrative. In (\ref{bkm:Ref416188091}), the speaker narrates that he moves away from the deictic center, as attested by his use of the distal marker ka- on the verb. Having reached this place, a second event takes place; he hears Claudia calling him. His hearing of Claudia takes place away from the deictic center, but no movement is involved; therefore, the distal marker is not used in (\ref{bkm:Ref74909097}).",bkm:Ref494982220,\gsrc kàsúmwínè bànyòkò | \gll ka-sumwin-é̲ ba-nyoko | \gls DIST-tell-PFV.SBJV NP2-mother | \glt ‘Go tell your mother.’,bkm:Ref416188091,\gsrc àhá ndíkàhùrá kùrwâmbà | \gll a-ha ndí̲-ka-hur-á̲ ku-ru-ámba | \gls DEM.I16 SM1SG.REL-DIST-arrive-FV NP17-NP11-middle_of_field | \glt ‘(…) when I reached the middle of the field…’,bkm:Ref74909097,\gsrc ndìshùwîrè bàklàùdìyà bàndìkûwà | \gll ndi-shuH-í̲re ba-klaudia ba-ndi-kú̲-a | \gls SM1SG-hear-STAT NP2-Claudia SM2-OM1SG-call | \glt ‘I heard Mrs. Claudia calling me.’,bkm:Ref416188091,\gsrc àhá ndíkàhùrá kùrwâmbà | \gll a-ha ndí̲-ka-hur-á̲ ku-ru-ámba | \gls DEM.I16 SM1SG.REL-DIST-arrive-FV NP17-NP11-middle_of_field | \glt ‘(…) when I reached the middle of the field…’,bkm:Ref74909097,\gsrc ndìshùwîrè bàklàùdìyà bàndìkûwà | \gll ndi-shuH-í̲re ba-klaudia ba-ndi-kú̲-a | \gls SM1SG-hear-STAT NP2-Claudia SM2-OM1SG-call | \glt ‘I heard Mrs. Claudia calling me.’,,,,,,,,,,

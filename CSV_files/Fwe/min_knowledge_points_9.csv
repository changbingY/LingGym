Aspect,Inceptive,,,,"The nominal use of the inceptive has most likely developed out of its verbal use, if the prefix was originally used on a verb ri ‘be’, followed by the loss of the verbal base ri and the reanalysis of the inceptive as a nominal prefix, as schematized in (\ref{bkm:Ref490244755}).\footnote{This grammaticalization also involves a tonal change, from a low-toned inceptive on verbs to a high-toned inceptive prefix as it is usually realized on nouns. This is the result of the high tone of the nominal augment; as discussed in \sectref{bkm:Ref444175456}, augments have a floating high tone that is never realized on the augment prefix itself, but always on the immediately preceding syllable.}",bkm:Ref490244755,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Aspect,Inceptive,,,,"The inceptive prefix may have developed from a lexical verb shak ‘want, like, love, need, look for’. Grammaticalization of earlier lexical verbs of volition into markers of proximative aspect (‘be about to’) is well-attested in African languages \citep{Heine1994}. The volitional element of the original lexical verb can still be seen in some uses of the inceptive sha-. For instance, the utterance in (\ref{bkm:Ref468374722}) was considered dubious, because it could be interpreted as the speaker wanting to become sick.",bkm:Ref468374722,\gsrc ?shèndìrwârà | \gll she-ndi-rwá̲r-a | \gls INC-SM1SG-be_sick-FV | \glt ‘I am getting sick/I want to get sick.’,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

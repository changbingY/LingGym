Introduction,Earlier research,,,,"{\citet{Seidel2005}} presents a dialectometrical classification of Caprivian languages, including Fwe, which he groups with Subiya, Mbalangwe and Totela, though disregarding Shanjo, which is not spoken in the Caprivi. As the focus of this article is on classification, it presents little in the way of analysis, though the appendix contains a small word list and a list of modern reflexes for reconstructed Bantu phonemes. {\citet{Bostoen2009}} describes the synchronic phoneme inventory and its diachronic development of both Fwe and Shanjo; as shown in chapters \ref{bkm:Ref451511011} and \ref{bkm:Ref451507583}, his findings on the phonology of Fwe mostly tally with mine. A discussion of the history of western Zambian peoples, including Fwe speakers, is presented by de Luna (\citealt{Luna2008,Luna2010,Luna2016}), though, as it is focused on historical analysis, it contains very little linguistic data. {\citet{BostoenSands2012}} discuss the use of clicks in Fwe as well as three other Bantu languages of northern Namibia; as discussed in \sectref{bkm:Ref70695065}, the click inventory that they present for Fwe differs slightly from the findings presented in this work. {\citet{Crane2012}} discusses the use of the verbal suffix -ite in various Bantu Botatwe languages, including a brief discussion of its use in Fwe; her analysis of this suffix in Fwe is taken over in the current study (see \sectref{bkm:Ref431984198}).",bkm:Ref451511011,Not found,bkm:Ref451507583,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Introduction,Data collection and transcription,,,,"The symbols used in this practical orthography will be explained in chapter \ref{bkm:Ref451511011} on segmental phonology. Each Fwe example in this work consists of four lines. The first line represents the phonetic realization of the entire sentence, phrase, or word, in which the surface realization of tones are marked. Phonetic and penultimate vowel lengthening are not marked, in order to distinguish them from phonemic vowel length, which is marked. No punctuation is used, as punctuation presumes an understanding of the syntactic structure, which is not available for every example. Periods to indicate the end of sentences are not used, because it is often unclear to me where a sentence ends, and what criteria can be used to establish sentence boundaries. Capitalization is not used, as tone marking is difficult to read on capitalized vowels, and because capitalized words may have grammatical prefixes or clitics. In order to avoid the question of which letter should be capitalized, capitalization is left out altogether. The second line of each example gives the underlying form, in which underlying tones are marked, and in which hyphens indicate morpheme boundaries. The third line gives a morpheme by mor\-pheme gloss, and the last line gives a free translation into English. These orthographical conventions only apply to the Fwe data. Whenever data on other languages are cited, the orthography of the original source is maintained.",bkm:Ref451511011,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

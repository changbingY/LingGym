In Fwe, however, intervening low tones are not required to trigger downstep, because downstep also occurs on adjacent high tones where there is no overt intervening low tone.

After the assignment of high tones and the application of tone rules, however, a high tone associ\-ated with one mora of a bimoraic syllable will automatically be copied onto the other mora of that syllable. This is illustrated in (\ref{bkm:Ref69986003}), where the high tone associated with the last syllable will retract to the second mora of the penultimate syllable in phrase-final context, and is subsequently copied to the first mora of the penultimate syllable in order to avoid a rising tone.

Tense,TAM constructions in Fwe,,,,"Events also differ in whether they conceptualize an onset phase, the phase leading up to the nucleus. Events with an onset phase are, for instance, nun ‘become fat’, where the nucleus consists of the pivotal transition into a state of being fat, and the onset phase consists of the drawn out process of becoming more and more fat, until the pivotal nucleus is reached. Events without an onset phase are, for instance, ŋatuk ‘break’, where there is no phase that leads up to the nuclear change of breaking.

Tense,Present,,,,"Semantically, the present construction has a wide variety of different interpretations, depending on lexical and grammatical aspect, linguistic and non-lin\-guis\-tic context. The basic meaning of the present construction is that the event’s nucleus is situated, at least partially, after the time of speaking (utterance time, UT). Whether the nucleus also overlaps with UT is not specified; it is possible, but not obligatory. The present construction only references the nuclear phase; an onset phase leading up to the nucleus cannot be targeted by the present construction. This results in a number of different possibilities, partially dependant on lexical aspect. (\ref{bkm:Ref75247169}) illustrates the interpretations of the present with dynamic verbs, using the verb bútuk ‘run’. It is possible for the entire nucleus of the verb to be situated after UT; this results in a futurate, modal or hypothetical interpretation ‘I will/would/can run’. It is also possible for the nucleus to overlap with UT, as long as it extends beyond UT, giving a progressive interpretation, ‘I am running’. It is also possible for the nucleus to be situated intermittently before and after UT, giving a habitual or generic/gnomic interpretation, ‘I (usually) run’.

Tense,Present,,,,"(\ref{bkm:Ref75248605}) illustrates the interpretation of the present with change of state verbs, using the change-of-state verb beng ‘become angry’. The nucleus of this verb describes the pivotal moment when the state of being angry is reached. For such verbs, it is not possible for the nucleus of the event to extend beyond UT as well as overlap with UT. A progressive interpretation is therefore excluded: the only way in which events with a short nucleus can satisfy the present construction’s criterion that the nucleus extends beyond UT is by situating the entire nucleus after UT.

Tense,Consecutive,,,,"Formally, the consecutive consists of an infinitive verb preced by a connective or a comitative clitic. The connective clitic consists of a connective stem and a pronominal prefix (see \sectref{bkm:Ref492133189} on connectives), which in the consecutive verb marks agreement with the intended subject.

Tense,Consecutive,,,,"As the base of the consecutive verb form is an infinitive verb, it displays the typical properties of infinitive verbs, namely lack of melodic tone (see also \sectref{bkm:Ref71539267} on melodic tone in TAM constructions), and the replacement of the infinitive prefix ku- with the distal prefix ka- to expresses an event taking place away from the place of speaking (see \sectref{bkm:Ref489965878} on the distal).

Tense,Consecutive,,,,"A consecutive verb can only be used when preceded by another, tense-in\-flect\-ed verb, and the consecutive verb is interpreted as occuring more or less directly after the event encoded by the inflected verb.

Clause combining,Introduction,,,,"In this chapter we will discuss several construction types in Kagayanen that involve clause combining. Most of these construction types involve one independent\is{independent clauses} \is{clauses!independent}clause and one or more dependent\is{dependent clauses}\is{clauses!dependent} clauses. We define an independent clause as one that is fully inflected\is{inflection} and capable of being integrated into discourse on its own. A dependent clause is one that depends on some other clause for at least part of its referential, temporal, or modal “grounding”. Such grounding information is also known as inflectional information (see \chapref{chap:verbstructure}, \sectref{sec:verbinflection} for further discussion)\is{inflectional information} For example, in the following English clause combination, clause \REF{bkm:Ref460480260} is dependent on clause \REF{bkm:Ref460395811} because the subject, tense, and modality of clause \REF{bkm:Ref460480260} are only understood via the subject, tense, and modality of clause \REF{bkm:Ref460395811}:",bkm:Ref460480260,Not found,bkm:Ref460395811,Not found,bkm:Ref460480260,Not found,bkm:Ref460395811,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,
Clause combining,Introduction,,,,"Clause \REF{bkm:Ref460395811} is grounded in time and modality by the past tense declarative form of the verb, and in participants by the subject pronoun she. Therefore, it may be used in discourse on its own and can be considered an independent clause. On the other hand, the verb locking has no subject or tense information, so clause \REF{bkm:Ref460480260} may not naturally be used in discourse on its own; it depends on clause \REF{bkm:Ref460395811} for this important information. Therefore clause \REF{bkm:Ref460480260} is a dependent \is{dependent clauses}clause.",bkm:Ref460395811,Not found,bkm:Ref460480260,Not found,bkm:Ref460395811,Not found,bkm:Ref460480260,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,
Clause combining,Nominalizations as dependent clauses,,,,"\is{nominalization|(}\is{dependent clauses!nominalization|(}A nominalization is a construction that describes an action, situation, or state, but has some structural characteristics of a noun. For example, \REF{bkm:Ref460480260} locking the door behind her, can be called a nominalized clause because it is not inflected for some important verbal categories such as tense, modality, and subject reference. It also has some properties of nouns-it can take a genitive (possessor) argument: her locking the door, and it can function as the subject of a sentence: Locking the door is a good idea.",bkm:Ref460480260,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Clause combining,Nominalizations as dependent clauses,Nominalizations as direct complement clauses,,,"In example \REF{bkm:Ref474213030}, the nominalized clause meaning ‘planting cassava’ is the absolutive argument of the main clause ‘s/he started . . .’ This is because the main verb is grammatically transitive (indicated by the prefix pa- and applicative suffix -an), the Actor is ergative, and there is no other argument that could possibly be the absolutive. Direct complement clauses are often absolutive arguments of transitive matrix clauses, as in \REF{bkm:Ref474213030}. Examples \REF{bkm:Ref114814303} through \REF{bkm:Ref114832637} are from the corpus.

Note that the verb tanem in example \REF{bkm:Ref114659732} has no inflection.

Clause combining,Nominalizations as dependent clauses,Nominalizations as oblique complement clauses,,,"In many cases, nominalized clauses are not absolutive or ergative arguments of their matrix as defined in the previous section, yet appear to be required to complete the idea expressed by the verb. Neither are they adverbial clauses because they are not optional sentence adjuncts (see \sectref{bkm:Ref115861741}). For these reasons, it makes sense to call them complement clauses – they “complete” the meaning of the main clause. However, they are not direct complements because there is no evidence that they are core arguments of the matrix verb. Therefore, we call such complements “oblique complements” or “OCs”.

Clause combining,Relative clauses,,,,"Like the English examples, the examples in \REF{bkm:Ref116889490} are all Referring Phrases with a clause-like element serving as a modifier of the head noun. Also, as in the English examples, the modifying clause (bolded) can be thought of as a shortened clause in which the omitted element is an RP which is coreferential with the head of the phrase. Unlike the English examples, in each of the Kagayanen examples the omitted element is the absolutive of the truncated clause. In Kagayanen grammar only the absolutive within a relative clause may be coreferential with the head noun of the phrase. Another difference between these examples and corresponding English examples is that in English, all the relative clauses follow the head noun of the phrase. In Kagayanen, relative clauses usually follow the head, but they also may precede the head, as in \REF{bkm:Ref116889490b}. This pattern is consistent with the syntax of Modification in general in Kagayanen. Recall from \chapref{chap:referringexpressions}, there are two modifier positions in Kagayanen Referring Phrases; the first, MOD1, occurs before the head, and the second, MOD2, follows the head. In general shorter relative clauses tend to occur in MOD1 position, while longer relative clauses tend to occur in MOD2 position.

In the English RP “my cooked anchovies” the speaker asserts that the anchovies are in a cooked state, but the identity of the person who cooked them is not part of the assertion.

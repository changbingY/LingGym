Morphosyntactically defined verb classes,Overview of eight classes of verbal roots,,,,"Examples \REF{bkm:Ref148453300}-\REF{bkm:Ref148453302} illustrate buong, ‘shatter’, a Class I root in intransitive, transitive and detransitive frames. Because Class I roots are punctual achievements, they do not take dynamic affixes in the basic intransitive frame. This is because dynamicity involves change over time--in Kagayanen, an object cannot “begin to shatter” or “be shattering”. In a transitive frame, these roots express direct causation, without a causative prefix. They may also take a causative prefix, in which case they express indirect causation (see \chapref{chap:voice}, \sectref{sec:causatives}).\footnote{Direct causation refers to situations in which a causer exerts direct control over the caused situation, for example, Melvin broke the window (caused the window to break), Shelly sank the boat (caused the boat to sink). Indirect causation refers to situations in which the agent of the caused situation (sometimes referred to as the causee), retains some control over the situation, for example, Melvin let Peter run wild, Shelly had Peter get a haircut.} In a detransitive frame, these verbs also express direct causation, but with the causee downplayed.",bkm:Ref148453300,Not found,bkm:Ref148453302,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some of these roots also fall into other classes with different meanings. For example, agi as a volitional intransitive activity means ‘to pass through’ (Class IV).

At times these core features may be extended into other domains (e.g. change of state may include change of place, as in to fall off accidentally). The inherent semantics of Class I roots so strongly favor these features that happenstantial modality is (almost) obligatory. Class II roots, on the other hand, may be interpreted as involving either a change of state, or an activity, depending on the context. Such situations may be expressed in either happenstantial or dynamic modalities, with corresponding differences in meaning.

In contrast to the non-volitional intransitive verbs, many of these verbs, but not all, can occur with the m{}- prefix, in which case the root-initial consonant drops out. Another characteristic of these volitional intransitive verbs is that in happenstantial modality, they occur with naka{}-/maka{}-, ka{}- (and ma{}- in the hypothetical/polite usage), but do not occur with the ambitransitive forms na- or ma-. Thus we can make the generalization that in happenstantial modality, constructions in which the absolutive is an Actor take naka-/maka{}- and those in which the absolutive is an Undergoer take na-/ma{}-.",bkm:Ref120784669,Not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Morphosyntactically defined verb classes,Roots describing volitional intransitive situations (Class IV),,,,"Another grammatical difference between non-volitional and volitional intransitive roots is that non-volitional roots may easily occur in a transitive frame to express direct causation (see \sectref{bkm:Ref148856716} above). Class IV roots, on the other hand, almost always require explicit transitivizing stem-forming morphology, either causative (pa{}-) or applicative (-an, -i) in order to occur in a transitive frame. This is because the causee is often animate, and therefore retains some control over the situation. However, if the causee is inanimate or otherwise incapable of controlling the situation, some of these roots may express direct causation in a transitive frame without the stem-forming causative prefix. For example, roots such as balik ‘return’, tago ‘hide’ and others that describe motion to a destination (return to a place, hide in a place) when used intransitively describe volitional situations \REF{bkm:Ref148946728}. When the same roots describe caused situations in which the causee is capable of exercising some control over the situation, the causative prefix is used, as in \REF{bkm:Ref148968257}. However, the same verbs may occur in a transitive \REF{bkm:Ref148946793} or detransitive \REF{bkm:Ref148946893} construction with no causative prefix, in which case they imply that the causee is probably inanimate, and therefore has no control or volition.

Stem-forming morphological processes,Root reduplication,,,,"Root reduplication was described in \chapref{chap:referringexpressions}, \sectref{sec:rootreduplication} for referential roots (or “nouns”), and in \chapref{chap:modification}, \sectref{sec:rootreduplication-derivation} for property concept roots (or “adjectives”). The same two processes, complete or partial root reduplication, occur with predicating roots (or “verbs”). The meaning of a partially or completely reduplicated verbal root may be repetitive, continuous, not really doing X, sort of doing X, or pretending to do X. The context usually distinguishes among these possibilities. The `not really doing,' `kind of doing', or `pretending to do' meanings are similar to the meanings associated with reduplicated nouns and adjectives. There is only one example in the texts of the `not really doing' sense (\ref{bkm:Ref361055761} below), but this usage does occur frequently in everyday conversation. For example, the root buat ‘do’/‘make’ when reduplicated buat-buat can mean ‘keep doing/making something’ or it can mean ‘make something up’ or ‘make believe’ (as in example \ref{bkm:Ref361055761}). The root suļat ‘to write’, when reduplicated suļat-suļat or sutsuļat may mean ‘continuously write’, in other contexts ‘write repeatedly’, and in still other contexts ‘scribble’ or ‘pretend to write’. Verbs denoting punctual changes in state, such as buong ‘to break’ or punctual changes in location, such as balik ‘return’, cannot express the ‘continuously’ meaning when reduplicated because this would be pragmatically odd---something can’t continuously break or return. Root reduplication for these verbs can only mean to ‘break repeatedly’, ‘return repeatedly’ or conceivably ‘sort of break’, ‘pretend to return’ (though these uses are not attested in the corpus, and are difficult for speakers to use or imagine outside of a specific communicative context). Occasionally there is a slight difference in meaning between complete and partial reduplication for the same root, but there is no consistent pattern. For example, the root sunod means ‘to follow’. Sunod-sunod means `to mimic', whereas sudsunod means `to follow', as in someone’s footsteps. Also, kaan-kaan is the general reduplicated form ‘to keep on eating’ (from kaan ‘eat’) while kankaan means `to graze', that is, animals eating with their heads down.",bkm:Ref361055761,"\gsrc Uyi na isturya matuod, dili ko nang \textbf{buat-buat} na isturya. | \gll U-yi na isturya matuod, dili ko nang \textbf{buat\sim{}buat} na isturya. | \gls EMPH-D1ADJ LK story true NEG.IR 1S.ERG only RED\simmake LK story | \glt ‘This story is true, (it is) not just my made up story.’",bkm:Ref361055761,"\gsrc Uyi na isturya matuod, dili ko nang \textbf{buat-buat} na isturya. | \gll U-yi na isturya matuod, dili ko nang \textbf{buat\sim{}buat} na isturya. | \gls EMPH-D1ADJ LK story true NEG.IR 1S.ERG only RED\simmake LK story | \glt ‘This story is true, (it is) not just my made up story.’",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stem-forming morphological processes,Applicative -an,,,,"One way of understanding this usage is that, since the applicative has the default function of indicating that the absolutive is a location, recipient or some other non-patient semantic role, the use of the applicative when the absolutive is a patient expresses that it is somehow a less than prototypical patient.

Stem-forming morphological processes,Reciprocal -ay and -anay,,,,"Since there is no consistent pattern of meaning variation between the two forms \nobreakdash-ay and \nobreakdash-anay when both are possible, we consider them to be partially autonomous allomorphs, and gloss them both as \textsc{rec}. It should also be noted that there is no reasonable sense in which -anay may be considered a combination of the applicative suffix -an plus -ay. First, there are no other situations in which two suffixes simultaneously appear on one verb. Second, examples with -anay have the same, intransitive, argument structure as those with -ay. Since the applicative construction normally changes the argument structure of the clause by making it transitive (see \ref{bkm:Ref394919927}), an applicative analysis of -anay is excluded.

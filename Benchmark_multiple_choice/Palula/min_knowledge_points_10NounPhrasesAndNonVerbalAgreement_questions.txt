Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The great majority of inflecting adjectives occur in the three forms ending -u, -a and -i (and an~additional but marginally used feminine plural -im in predicative sentences, see \sectref{subsec:10-3-3} below). There is thus agreement with the noun head in gender, number and case. Whereas agreement in gender is consistently maintained, compare (\ref{ex:10-50}) with (\ref{ex:10-51}), number agreement (compare (\ref{ex:10-52}) with (\ref{ex:10-53})) and case agreement (compare (\ref{ex:10-54}) with (\ref{ex:10-55})) is mostly neutralised.

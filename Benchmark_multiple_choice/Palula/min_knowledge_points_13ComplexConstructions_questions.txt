In some of the cases where it does occur on its own, it is not entirely clear whether it should instead be understood as an unusual use of the homophonous general subordinator the morpheme ___.} and another particle ba (also with other discourse functions, see \sectref{sec:14-4}) placed immediately after the first (and similarly topicalised) constituent of the next clause with which the first"=mentioned is contrasted. As is apparent from examples (\ref{ex:13-23})--(\ref{ex:13-25}), the coordination itself is, like the use of bi, sentential rather than phrasal.

Question 406:
You are a linguist specializing in Palula. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): uṭ-á maníit-u índa násel ___ pakaár na bh-éen-i
Gloss (with missing item): camel-OBL say.PFV"=MSG here lineage ___ need NEG become-PRS-F
The English translation of this sentence is:`The camel said, ``There is no need here for lineage or honour.'''
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Related utterances in Palula always occur as direct quotations, as can be seen in the examples (\ref{ex:13-127})--(\ref{ex:13-131}), or more correctly, they are always presented from a~quoted"=speaker's or experiencer's (i.e., the subject of the matrix clause) perspective, as far as deixis, pronominal and time reference is concerned. Non"=oral perception or cognition\footnote{It is probably equally possible to classify the predicate in a~sentence like this as desiderative~-- i.e., expressing a~desire that the proposition be realised~-- rather than as an~uttererance predicate.} is treated in this way too, i.e., thoughts, as in (\ref{ex:13-132}), are presented from the thinking agent's perspective, as if they were uttered orally (a marginal exception to this is found with what I refer to below as ``immediate perception predicates'').

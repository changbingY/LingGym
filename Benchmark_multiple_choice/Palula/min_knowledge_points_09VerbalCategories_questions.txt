Sentence (with missing item): áak haftá muṣṭú ___ de
Gloss (with missing item): one week back ___ PST
The English translation of this sentence is:`[I] saw him a~week ago.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: There seems to be a~drift towards a~use of Pluperfect as a~general remote past, not an~uncommon development generally \citep[147]{dahl1985}, and in the region in particular. However, that is not to say that the two constructions~-- Simple Past and Pluperfect~-- would therefore be in totally free variation when referring to remote past, although I am not able to pinpoint exactly where the dividing line goes. The utterance in (\ref{ex:9-40}) is an~answer to the question whether the speaker had met the other person recently, and it could perhaps be that it is the temporal adverbial phrase that somehow favours the Pluperfect, but this is so far only speculative on my part.

You are a linguist specializing in Palula. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): so típa ___
Gloss (with missing item): 3SG.NOM now ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`He is about to leave./He must leave now.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: It seems the agent is generally avoided with obligative transitive verbs, and as such it is also becoming an~alternative way of expressing a~passive meaning (compare with \sectref{subsec:8-5-2}), with a sense of ability (or inability) rather than one of obligation. I would still hold that Obligative is primarily modality and only secondarily voice. Possibly related to the degree of obligation is an~alternation between the coding of the agent in the nominative, as in (\ref{ex:9-59}), versus the genitive coding we saw above in (\ref{ex:9-55}).

Sentence (with missing item): \label{bkm:Ref190746425}bíiḍ-u muṣṭú áak miiš-íi áak dhií de ___
Gloss (with missing item): much-MSG before IDEF man-GEN IDEF daughter be.PST ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`A long time ago there was a~man who had a~daughter.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Hearsay, formed with the morpheme ___, is grammaticalised to a~much lower extent than the hitherto mentioned categories, and is thus only in a~peripheral sense part of the TMA system. When it occurs, it occurs at the end of a~sentence, like an~auxiliary, after the inflected finite verb form (whether simple or periphrastically formed) to indicate reported (but not self"=experienced) information. It is chiefly (but optionally) used in narratives, especially those of a~legendary character, and mostly at the beginning of such narratives, which is seen in (\ref{ex:9-60}).\footnote{I am inclined not to consider it a~story starter as such; that function is instead carried by bíiḍu muṣṭú, muṣṭú zamaanáii, muxáak zamaanée, or similar more or less standardised story"=starters. The initial sentence's occurrence of the participant"=introduction heensílu de `there was' is also typical of the Palula storytelling discourse.}

The English translation of this sentence is:`He understood that someone else had taken his wife away.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Related to this issue, is the use of the quotation marker the morpheme ___, with a~similar etymology, which may develop into an~auxiliary. Triggered by the verb"=final word order, it may become restricted to the position after the finite verb and become narrowed down to this particular verb form.\footnote{It is still alternatively expressed with other verb forms.} In the process, it may also become a~marker of a~more grammaticalised inferentiality category, as such contrasting with Hearsay, rather than now as chiefly a~marker of direct quotation/perception (see \sectref{subsec:13-5-1}). In (\ref{ex:9-63}) it has taken on a~function beyond mere quotation.

Sentence (with missing item): aḍaphará ___ ba damá thíil-u
Gloss (with missing item): halfways ___ TOP pause do.PFV"=MSG
The English translation of this sentence is:`Halfway down, we rested.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The Converb -- defined by \citet{haspelmath1995} as ``a non"=finite verb form whose main function is to mark adverbial subordination'' -- is essentially a~perfective adverbial participle (compare with the Copredicative Participle, \sectref{subsec:9-3-5}, which is an~imperfective adverbial participle). There is a similarly"=functioning participle in many other IA languages, often referred to as a~conjunctive participle.\footnote{The identification of the corresponding verb form in Kohistani Shina with the converb, according to \citeauthor{haspelmath1995}'s (\citeyear{haspelmath1995}) definition, is carried through in \citealt{schmidt2003}.} It is a~characteristic, very frequently occurring, and syntactically important non"=finite verb form \citep[323, 397--401]{masica1991}. Like in many of those other languages, the Palula Converb carries an~approximate meaning of `having done, etc.' It is (as \citeauthor{haspelmath1995}'s definition also spells out) especially important in adverbial subordination and in expressing perfective sequentiality, as illustrated in (\ref{ex:9-64}).See \sectref{subsec:13-3-1} and \sectref{subsec:13-4-1} for further details.

Sentence (with missing item): eetás ___ pahúrta
Gloss (with missing item): 3SG.REM.ACC ___ after
The English translation of this sentence is:`After the [completed] construction of it{...}'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Since the Perfective Participle is formally identical to the Simple Past (and as such has become a~finite verb form), it only occurs marginally in what must be interpreted as a~non"=finite function. When it does, such as in the (perfective) nominalisations below, it can also (but not consistently so) be inflected for case, genitive in (\ref{ex:9-65}) and oblique in (\ref{ex:9-66}).
A: word: samóol-u	 gloss: build.PFV"=MSG

The English translation of this sentence is:`When I came yesterday, he had [just] written two letters.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Since the Perfective Participle is formally identical to the Simple Past (and as such has become a~finite verb form), it only occurs marginally in what must be interpreted as a~non"=finite function. When it does, such as in the (perfective) nominalisations below, it can also (but not consistently so) be inflected for case, genitive in (\ref{ex:9-65}) and oblique in (\ref{ex:9-66}).

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Although textually not as frequent as the Converb, it is a~category used in a~number of dependent clauses, such being the predicate in many complement clauses (for details, see \sectref{sec:13-5}), as in (\ref{ex:9-69}), as well as in some clauses with adverbial functions (see \sectref{sec:13-4}).

The English translation of this sentence is:`He was an expert in making amulets and in providing deliverance from djinns.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The Agentive Verbal Noun is another nominalisation but in many ways it is secondary as a~nominal formation and is semantically rather restricted. It is a~way of singling out an~agent of an~action (provided with a~gender/number ending) but often reflects a~more idiomatic or lexicalised meaning than the semantics of the verb itself. When used as nouns they inflect as nouns, see (\ref{ex:9-72}), but they can equally well function as adjectival modifiers of other nouns, as in (\ref{ex:9-73}).

The English translation of this sentence is:`As he smoked a~cigarette in the room, in front of him, his son had started to look at him.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The Agentive Verbal Noun also occurs rather systematically in a~special construction with bhílu hínu `has become'. In this case, the whole sentence communicates either the beginning of an~event (possibly leading up to some sort of climax) or the co"=occurrence of two events, as in (\ref{ex:9-74}). This may be related to the vālā of Urdu"=Hindi, which, added to the oblique form of the infinitive,\footnote{The Urdu verb form with an~ending -nā is traditionally called an~infinitive but occurs in a~number of constructions, often as a~verbal noun and as such being subject to case inflection \citep[132--142]{schmidt1999}.} captures a~meaning of imminent action \citep[139]{schmidt1999}.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The Agentive Verbal Noun also occurs rather systematically in a~special construction with bhílu hínu `has become'. In this case, the whole sentence communicates either the beginning of an~event (possibly leading up to some sort of climax) or the co"=occurrence of two events, as in (\ref{ex:9-74}). This may be related to the vālā of Urdu"=Hindi, which, added to the oblique form of the infinitive,\footnote{The Urdu verb form with an~ending -nā is traditionally called an~infinitive but occurs in a~number of constructions, often as a~verbal noun and as such being subject to case inflection \citep[132--142]{schmidt1999}.} captures a~meaning of imminent action \citep[139]{schmidt1999}.

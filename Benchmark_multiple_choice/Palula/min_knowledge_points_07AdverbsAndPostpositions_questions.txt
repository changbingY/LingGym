Question 21:
You are a linguist specializing in Palula. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option.

The English translation of this sentence is:`The flock got down before us, and then we came down behind.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: \spitzmarke{patú `its gloss ___, in back'.} This basic form is, according to my material, only used as a~postpostion (in A) or conjunction (in B), see \sectref{subsec:7-2-2}; however, a~couple of (partly spatial, partly temporal) adverbial expressions are clearly derived from it: patuɡiraá (exemplified in (\ref{ex:7-14}))/patuɡiróo/paturaá (A)/patuɡiráak (B) `back', \textit{the morpheme ___ ({\textless} patú + dúši)} `its gloss ___', as in (\ref{ex:7-15}), the latter almost exclusively used in a~temporal sense in B (compare with \sectref{subsec:7-1-3}).
A: word: padúši	 gloss: behind

A nearly synonymous muṣṭuɡiraá is also derived from it.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Another kind of complex postposition consists of a~sequence of two simple postpositions. The first in the sequence is the semantically more central one, whereas the second is a~further fine"=tuning or specification, usually as far as the direction is concerned.

It should be noted that the noun preceding the postpositional sequence is regularly assigned case by the first component of the sequence.

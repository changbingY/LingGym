Sentence (with missing item): ___ wa lolok tak-karuok
Gloss (with missing item): ___ PROX leaf CLF_LEAF-three
The English translation of this sentence is:`This is mine. It has three leaves.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The freestanding possessive pronouns can be used both as NP heads and as modifiers, whereas the suffixes always have to be attached to the NP head (the possessed noun). Adnominal use of the freestanding possessive pronoun was illustrated in~(\ref{exe:posspron}) and~(\ref{exe:possdouble}) above. A pronominal example is given in~(\ref{exe:anggonawa}).
A: word: anggon=at=a	 gloss: 1SG.POSS=OBJ=FOC
B: word: pokpok=kin	 gloss: small_motor_boat=POSS
C: word: anggon=a	 gloss: 1SG.POSS=FOC

Sentence (with missing item): ___ tara-un=a Pakpak=a bot=kin
Gloss (with missing item): ___ grandparent-3POSS=FOC Fakfak=FOC go=VOL
The English translation of this sentence is:`Dian's grandfather wants to go to Fakfak.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The corpus contains ten different nouns that are followed by freestanding possessive pronouns. Six of these nouns are also found with a possessive suffix, which means they do not require a possessive pronoun construction.\footnote{These are pendapat `opinion' (Malay loan), toman `bag', hak `right' (Malay loan), kewe `house', asal `origin' (Malay loan) and guru `teacher' (Malay loan). A reason that many of these are Malay loans might be that possessive constructions in Papuan Malay are made with a periphrastic construction (possessor + `have' + possessum), which might trigger the use of a possessive pronoun instead of a suffix in Kalamang. In any case, the number of occurrences of these words is so low in comparison to those of esa `father' and ema `mother' that we will not consider them any further.} Wowa `aunt' and tata `grandfather' are not found with a possessive suffix, but are uncommon in the corpus. Esa `father' and ema `mother' are only found with a third-person possessive suffix, and only in teknonyms, as in~(\ref{exe:nyongemun}) and~(\ref{exe:the morpheme ___taraun}) above (see also §\ref{sec:names}).
A: word: kian	 gloss: wife.1SG.POSS

Sentence (with missing item): an bo lembaga nerun ___ se bo temun
Gloss (with missing item): 1SG go prison inside ___ IAM go big
The English translation of this sentence is:`I went to prison, and my child has grown big.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: At this point, it is unclear whether other kinship\is{kinship} terms also require a possessive pronoun.\footnote{There is no restriction against a possessive suffix on a noun ending in /a/, cf. nika-an `my fishing line'.} Besides three occurrences of tata `grandfather' and one of wowa `aunt', there are no possessive constructions with other kinship terms. The only exception to this is the five inalienable\is{alienability} terms mentioned in §\ref{sec:posssuf}, which must carry a possessive suffix, as well as tumun `child', which may carry a possessive suffix, as was illustrated in~(\ref{exe:tumunan}) above. What is clear, however, is that words from the same semantic class (kinship terms) may behave differently with respect to possessive constructions. This also shows that alienability of the possessed does not play a role in the choice of a possessive construction, as is common elsewhere in East Indonesia \parencite[see e.g.][]{klamer2008}. Note that kinship terms are also treated differently from other nouns in possessive constructions in other languages, notably Italian and Scandinavian \parencite{delsing2002}.

Sentence (with missing item): an me kor-an=a ___ main=ko
Gloss (with missing item): 1SG TOP foot-1SG.POSS=FOC ___ 3POSS=LOC
The English translation of this sentence is:`As for me, I put my foot in his footprints.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: A possessive suffix and a freestanding possessive pronoun may also be adjacent when the suffix and the pronoun designate different referents. This can happen when the suffix is needed to make a compound, such as `foot-print' in~(\ref{exe:korter}). The possessive pronoun is then needed to indicate the possessor of the footprint. This is very rare: only two examples exist in the corpus.
A: word: inggon	 gloss: 1PL.EXCL.POSS

Sentence (with missing item): wienar ___
Gloss (with missing item): parrotfish ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`roundhead parrotfish'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Other examples of spatial association are the names of certain species, especially fish species, as shown in~(\ref{exe:wienart}). The wienar `parrotfish' is contrasted with other wienar species, such as wienar saruam `longnose parrotfish'. It can also be used in a more general sense to group for example all fish found close to the shore, as in~(\ref{exe:sorkis}).
A: word: tebol=kin	 gloss: reef_edge=POSS

Sentence (with missing item): Dian tara-un ___
Gloss (with missing item): Dian grandfather-3POSS ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`Dian's grandfather's and associates'.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: =kin can also express general (associative) ownership without specifying the possessor. This can be used, for example, with the question word naman `who', as in~(\ref{exe:namankin}). The answer to this question also contains =kin, marking the possession of a group of people. Thus, naman=kin functions as a \is{placeholder}placeholder for Dian taraun the morpheme ___. The answer also contains the third-person plural pronoun mu used as an associative plural.\is{associative plural}
A: word: limabelas=kin=at	 gloss: 15_hp_motor_boat.MLY=POSS=OBJ

Gloss (with missing item): then not father ___ then 2PL use=NFIN
The English translation of this sentence is:`If not, you can use your father's.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Interestingly, because =kin is attached to the last element of the NP, it can also be attached to a possessive pronoun. In~(\ref{exe:esakainkin}), the use of =kin (instead of third-person possessive -un) signals that the possessed item, some fishing equipment, belongs to the father's household and not to him personally.
A: word: raor=kin=at	 gloss: middle=POSS=OBJ
B: word: kain=kin	 gloss: 2SG.POSS=POSS
C: word: kain	 gloss: 2SG.POSS

Gloss (with missing item): thousand ___ TOP DIST.INS sail_fish
The English translation of this sentence is:`With [fishing line of the kind that costs] ten thousand [you go] fishing while sailing around.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In~(\ref{exe:konkin}), =kin attaches to a numeral, which refers to the price of a certain size of fishing line (the word nika `line' is elided). =kin indicates that the numeral is representative of a type.

Gloss (with missing item): ___ CAUS=ascend=PLNK finish then right=POSS=OBJ then drill=again
The English translation of this sentence is:`After putting up the left side, we drill the right side again.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Lastly, =kin is used by one speaker in two recordings about canoe building to refer to parts of the canoe. In~(\ref{exe:tantayonkin}), the left and right side of the canoe are described, and either side is marked with =kin. In~(\ref{exe:ass3}), the canoes are the parts, and the whole is a tree from which three canoes are cut. An alternative analysis is that these uses of =kin do not indicate a part-whole relationship, but that there is an understood nominal referent with which =kin expresses an associative relationship. In~(\ref{exe:tantayonkin}), this could be the drill holes (the left side's drill holes), and in~(\ref{exe:ass3}), the wood or the motor boat's base.
A: word: anggon=a	 gloss: 1SG.POSS=FOC

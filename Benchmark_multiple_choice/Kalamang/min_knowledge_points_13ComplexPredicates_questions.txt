Sentence (with missing item): jie ___
Gloss (with missing item): get ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`Go get!'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: All elements in complex predicates, being part of the same clause, have the same mood\is{mood}, aspect\is{aspect} and polarity\is{polarity}, which is only marked on the last verb. In other words, there can only be one instance of the same mood, aspect or modality marking per clause. An example of shared mood with the plural imperative is given in~(\ref{exe:jieborar}), contrasted with a biclausal example in~(\ref{exe:jierarku}). An example with a complex predicate with predicate linker =i is given in~(\ref{exe:cimei}).

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Completive aspect is expressed with the construction Verb=i koyet, where =i is attached to a matrix verb of any kind.

Multiple monoclausal Verb=i koyet constructions may be strung together in this way. There are no restrictions on the first verb in the predicate. Both verbs in the predicate share the same arguments. (\ref{exe:ewunat}) shows the construction with a transitive verb in a narrative about making a canoe from a tree trunk. (\ref{exe:yoriko}) is taken from the end of that narrative, and shows the construction on an intransitive verb. Although it is uncommon, even the verb koyet `to be finished' may be used as the matrix verb in this construction, as in~(\ref{exe:koyeri}).

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: As with aspectual serialisation (§\ref{sec:ikoyetsvc}), other complex predicates with predicate linker =i may also contain more than one verb. For example, in the manner + direction construction in~(\ref{exe:sirnag}), both manner verbs are marked with =i. Again, there is not enough data in the corpus to determine patterns in the (semantic) relationship between the verbs in the construction.
A: word: luk	 gloss: come
B: word: masarat=nin=et	 gloss: move_landwards=NEG=IRR
C: word: ran	 gloss: go
D: word: yap_seran-un	 gloss: yam-3POSS

Question 24:
You are a linguist specializing in Kalamang. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): wa me paden taikon ___ saran
Gloss (with missing item): PROX TOP pole one_side ___ ascend
The English translation of this sentence is:`This one, a yellow pole goes down on one side.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: This is also the case for NPs carrying similative postposition\is{postposition!similative} =kap, like ododa `gado-gado' (a dish) in~(\ref{exe:ododang}). Most colour terms end in -gap or -kap and are probably derived from nouns marked with similative =kap (§\ref{sec:sim}), but are treated as monomorphemic. They can also be inflected with =i and become part of a complex predicate, like baranggap `yellow' in~(\ref{exe:gawi}).
A: word: baranggap=i	 gloss: yellow=PLNK
B: word: siktak∼tak=i	 gloss: slow∼INTS=PLNK
C: word: nawanggar	 gloss: wait
D: word: potma	 gloss: cut

Sentence (with missing item): o mu se kaka=at ___ rua
Gloss (with missing item): INT 3PL IAM older_sibling=OBJ ___ kill
The English translation of this sentence is:`O, they killed the older brother (by stabbing).'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Complex action and result predicates express an action in the first verb and a result in the second verb. Like resultative SVCs, §\ref{sec:ressvc}, they are rare. One natural spoken corpus example is~(\ref{exe:kakat}) with the verbs komain `to stab' and rua `to kill'. The object of the first verb is the subject of the second, such that the verbs in the construction do not share any arguments. In~(\ref{exe:dakcamp}), it is unclear exactly whether campur `to mix' is the result obtained by chopping two ingredients and the same time, or whether this should be read as two sequential events. The same conversation also contains the construction kawareni campur `grate mix'.
A: word: komain=et	 gloss: puncture=IRR

You are a linguist specializing in Kalamang. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ___ mindi bo kararak koi masan
Gloss (with missing item): ___ like_that go dry then dry_in_sun
The English translation of this sentence is:`We dry [on a rack above the fire] until it's dry, then we dry in the sun.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The `until'-constructions with bo `to go' illustrated in~(\ref{exe:kadok}) and~(\ref{exe:kuarkuar}) are also often found with distal manner \is{demonstrative!manner}demonstrative mindi and another verb, marked with predicate linker =i.

The construction can be elaborated with mendak, a demonstrative form probably derived from distal demonstrative me and clitic =tak `just', meaning `just like that' (§\ref{sec:distmann}). The `until'-construction then takes the form mendak=i + mindi + bo (example~\ref{exe:nasuis}). See §\ref{sec:distmann} for a discussion of the uses of the distal manner demonstrative mindi.

An example with bara `to descend' is given in~(\ref{exe:the morpheme ___bara}).\footnote{It is unclear whether the morpheme ___ `its gloss ___' can be used without volitional =kin (§\ref{sec:kin}). The corpus instances of the morpheme ___ followed by a verb that is not marked with =kin are ambiguous between the `its gloss ___' and the `say; think' reading.}

The English translation of this sentence is:`You go in the back!'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: NPs with locative postpositions =ko or =konggo are commonly used predicatively, as in~(\ref{exe:locpred}), where there is no verb in the clause and the location `Wagom' marked with the locative postposition translates as `be in Wagom'. When used predicatively, \mbox{=ko} is inflected accordingly with e.g. the negator =nin (example~\ref{exe:kolaonin}) or \is{imperative}imperative =te (example~\ref{exe:orkore}).
A: word: bolon-i	 gloss: little-OBJQNT

You are a linguist specializing in Kalamang. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): tebonggan koi ecien=i ___
Gloss (with missing item): everyone then return=PLNK ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`Then everyone returned home.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Locatives may occur with verbs, although no verb requires a locative complement. Some verbs, like ecie `to return' and bo `to go', must precede a locative (\ref{exe:Vloc}), and occur in constructions where movement towards a goal is expressed, rather than location. It is only in these instances where the locative is used in movement contexts that the locative may be inflected for imperative mood (§\ref{sec:imp}). Other verbs, like melelu `to sit', follow the locative (\ref{exe:locV}). The behaviour of different verbs with locatives is further described in §\ref{sec:svcloclat}.
A: word: kewe=ko	 gloss: house=LOC
B: word: kewe=at=a	 gloss: house=OBJ=FOC

Sentence (with missing item): an ___
Gloss (with missing item): 1SG ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`I was in Wagom.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: There are two ways to mark NPs with locative =ko \parencite[cf.][]{huber2018}. When there is no ambiguity with regard to the location of the referent, or when the location is big or generic, =ko can be attached to a NP consisting of just a noun. This applies to place names\is{names!place names} (see \ref{exe:locpred}), landscape features such as kolak `forest; mountain; mainland' or pasier `sea' (see \ref{exe:kolaonin}) and kewe `house' (see \ref{exe:Vloc}). With smaller and more specific nouns, like bakul `basket' (see \ref{exe:locV}) or kaden `body' (see \ref{exe:pepkaden}), the exact location has to be specified with the help of a relational noun. These nouns are commonly inflected with possessive suffix -un and and then followed by locative =ko (see Table~\ref{tab:locationals} in §\ref{sec:inal}). These roots cannot stand alone as a subject, object or location, but must be inflected with possessive -un, locative =ko, both -un and =ko, -pis `side', or -kadok `side'. Alternatively, they may be followed by a local demonstrative, as in~(\ref{exe:elak}).

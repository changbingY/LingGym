Gloss (with missing item): water 3SG.SUBJ ground 3SG.OBJ=atop ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`There is water on the ground.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Often context alone can determine whether a \isi{copula}r \isi{suffix} is being used in an existential construction or a \isi{locative} construction. Thus, for example, a sentence such as \REF{ex:pred:20} could be interpreted as meaning ‘the water is on the ground’ as well as ‘there is water on the ground’.
A: word: ma=p	 gloss: 3SG.OBJ=be

Sentence (with missing item): mï amun=p-e ___
Gloss (with missing item): 3SG.SUBJ now=COP-DEP ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`He is still there.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The verb p- ‘be’ (or the \isi{copular enclitic} =p ‘\textsc{cop}’) may be used with \isi{temporal adverb}s or nouns as well, here having a \isi{temporal}, rather than a spatial meaning, as in the expression amunpe ‘still’ in \REF{ex:pred:10}. This can be understood as having the literal meaning ‘being at now’. See \sectref{sec:8.2.1} for more examples of \isi{temporal} expressions. The special \isi{past}-\isi{tense} form of the \isi{locative verb} (wap ‘be.\textsc{pst}’) is discussed in \sectref{sec:10.4}.
A: word: anda=p-e	 gloss: SG.DIST=be-IPFV

Sentence (with missing item): Mongima mï ___
Gloss (with missing item): [name] 3SG.SUBJ ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`Mongima is a man.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Aside from \isi{locational predication}, which requires the \isi{locative verb} p- {\textasciitilde} wap ‘be’, \isi{non-verbal predication} (as well as other \isi{non-verbal clause} constructions) can be expressed without any overt verbal marking. Thus, Ulwa can be said to allow \isi{zero copula} constructions (see \sectref{sec:10.3}, however, for the use of a \isi{copular enclitic}). For example, \is{classificational clause} classificational, \is{identificational clause} identificational, or \is{equational clause} equational (or \is{equative clause} equative) clauses may all be expressed by simply \isi{juxtaposing} two NPs without any marking, as in examples \REF{ex:pred:22} through \REF{ex:pred:27}.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: While it is theoretically possible that \isi{perfective} forms of the verb may be used in such constructions as well (i.e., the \isi{suppletive} form i ‘go.\textsc{pfv’}), I do not have clear examples of this. Some apparent examples of \isi{periphrastic} \isi{future} constructions with i ‘go.\textsc{pfv}’ are in fact constructions with \isi{purpose clause}s, which also contain \isi{irrealis} verb forms. For example, sentences \REF{ex:pred:59} and \REF{ex:pred:60} are not analyzed as \isi{periphrastic} \isi{future} constructions, but rather as \isi{purpose} constructions.

You are a linguist specializing in Ulwa. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ndï apïn=n anul ___ ma-n-e mï ipka i
Gloss (with missing item): 3PL fire=OBL grassland ___ go-IPFV-DEP 3SG.SUBJ before go.PFV
The English translation of this sentence is:`They were going to burn the grassland, but he went ahead [of them].’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Indeed, it is often difficult to determine whether a ‘going’ verb is marking futurity or \isi{purpose}. This is perhaps unsurprising, if one assumes the likely historical change of: verb of \isi{motion} > \isi{purpose} > \isi{future}. In examples \REF{ex:pred:61} and \REF{ex:pred:62}, the \ili{English} translations capture the ambiguity well. In \REF{ex:pred:61}, a reading in which the ‘going’ verb marks futurity would suggest that the first clause is \isi{counterfactual}.

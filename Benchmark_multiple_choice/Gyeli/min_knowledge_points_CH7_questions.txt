Question 0:
You are a linguist specializing in Gyeli. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): le-njù ___ nábèbè
Gloss (with missing item): le5-banana ___ red
The English translation of this sentence is:`The banana is red.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Based on the argument that the clauses in \REF{John1} and \REF{John} are structurally the same, while the parts of speech status and morphosyntactic behavior of their copula elements differ, I treat both non-verbal and verbal copulas in Gyeli within the same chapter, although in different sections. Another argument for organizing non-verbal and verbal copulas within the same clause type is that the choice of either one in Gyeli often depends on the tense, aspect, mood, and polarity category of the clause. In \REF{banana1}, a non-verbal copula is used in the present, whereas a verbal copula, an inflected form of {\itshape bɛ̀} `be', has to be used in \REF{banana2} for its negated version and in \REF{banana3} for the past.

Gloss (with missing item): 1SG-PRS think-R COMP emptyset7.scar there 7-OBJ ___ 7.DEM.PROX
The English translation of this sentence is:`I think, the scar there is this.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: As \citet[1812]{mikkelsen2011} states for English, ``[i]dentificational clauses are characterized by having a demonstrative pronoun or demonstrative phrase in the subject position''. In Gyeli, the demonstrative does not occur in the subject, but in the predicate position. Nevertheless, I label {\itshape the morpheme ___} as an identificational marker, since it takes over the same function, namely identifying people, places, and the location of things. In \REF{we1}, the speaker identifies his younger brother by using a deictic demonstrative, at the same time pointing to the person in question. In \REF{we2}, the chief of Ngolo talks about a scar on his forehead, identifying its location and again pointing to it.

Sentence (with missing item): nyɛ ___ (nû)
Gloss (with missing item): 1.SBJ ___ (1.DEM.PROX)
The English translation of this sentence is:`This is him.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The second type of construction where {\itshape the morpheme ___} is used is without a predicate. In \REF{we5}, the parentheses indicate that the use of the demonstrative is optional. Often, the demonstrative is not expressed, so that only the subject and {\itshape the morpheme ___} surface. In that sense, {\itshape the morpheme ___} is not a real copula here, since it does not link a subject to another constituent. It has its origin, however, in a copula construction. Environments where {\itshape the morpheme ___} is used phrase finally, i.e.\ without demonstrative or anaphoric marker, are usually those where the subject is a personal pronoun as in \REF{we5}.

Here, the personal pronoun is followed by the proper name and the identificational marker {\itshape the morpheme ___} occurs phrase finally. They differ from the above examples in that {\itshape the morpheme ___} is not a linking element, but rather functions as a deictic itself. In this view, it is not surprising that proper name constructions with {\itshape the morpheme ___} do not involve demonstratives or anaphoric markers.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: {\itshape the morpheme ___} differs from other verbs including the copula {\itshape bɛ̀} in its tonal behavior on the \textsc{stamp} marker. Comparable to, for instance, the \textsc{future} tense-mood category, the first and second person singular and the \textsc{stamp} marker of class 1 have a different tonal pattern, namely an L tone, than the \textsc{stamp} markers of the other agreement classes, which have an H tone, as in \REF{budeb}. As to the tonal shape of the verb {\itshape the morpheme ___}, it always ends in an H tone, which suggests that it belongs to the realis mood, as discussed in \sectref{sec:SynH}. Since {\itshape the morpheme ___} never occurs phrase finally, however, it is not possible to prove that its final TBU is underlyingly L. I therefore gloss the realis H tone as being inherent to the verb.

You are a linguist specializing in Gyeli. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): a ___ mà m-ùdã̂
Gloss (with missing item): 1 ___ COMPL[Kwasio] N1-woman
The English translation of this sentence is:`He already has a wife.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The distribution of {\itshape the morpheme ___} seems to be restricted to the \textsc{present} tense-mood category. Given the special tonal pattern of the \textsc{stamp} marker, which differs from the general \textsc{present} tonal pattern, tense-mood category affiliation cannot be determined by the default tonal shape. Speakers consistently translate clauses with {\itshape the morpheme ___} with the \textsc{present}. The same is true for the special construction involving the Kwasio loan form of the \textsc{absolute completive} marker {\itshape mà}. As discussed in \sectref{sec:COMPL}, the Gyeli completive marker {\itshape mɔ̀/-Ṽ} is restricted to the \textsc{recent past}. In \REF{budema}, however, it occurs with {\itshape the morpheme ___} and speakers translate the sentence in the \textsc{present} into French as {\itshape Il a déjà une femme.}

The English translation of this sentence is:`Books are written (by people).'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Another diagnostic that is often used in determining objects in Bantu is passivization. In Gyeli, passivization is a rare process that mostly shows up in elicitations, but not in natural speech. I therefore do not consider passivization a good diagnostic for objecthood, even though simple constructions such as in \REF{passdefa} yield the expected results. As described in \sectref{sec:PASS}, the object of an active construction, as in \REF{passdef1a}, corresponds to the subject of a passive construction, as in \REF{passdef2a}, while the subject of an active construction can optionally be expressed as an oblique in the passive construction.

Sentence (with missing item): wɛ nzíí bàlɛ ___
Gloss (with missing item): 2SG PROG.PRS keep ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`You are recording the story [lit. you are keeping the words].'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Objects in Gyeli are marked by a syntactic H\footnote{Bantu languages are well known for their inflectional melodic tones on verb stems \citep{odden2014}, yet tonal alternations that are realized after the verb, entering the syntax of the broader VP, are less studied. Tone-cases reported for some western Bantu languages, e.g. in Otjiherero R31 \citep{Wal2015}, constitute a famous exception, illustrating that tonal alternations on the object noun class prefix correlate with object and information structure marking in a subset of tenses. Other phenomena that possibly include tonal alternations on postverbal material are the conjoint/disjoint distinction, broadly related to information structure distinctions in eastern Bantu \citep{Wal2017}, and ``metatony'' in northwestern Bantu, e.g. in Abo A42 \citep{hyman2012}, where immediate-after-verb nominal object prefixes surface H if they follow verbs ending H. In both cases, however, the tonal alternation of object nouns originates from and depends on the tonal shape of the preceding verb, which is not the case in Gyeli.} tone that attaches to underlyingly toneless tone bearing units of the object noun, namely to CV- noun class prefixes.\footnote{There is one other toneless element that the syntactic object-linking H tone can be realized on, namely the verbal plural particle {\itshape nga} (\sectref{sec:nga}), which seems to ``steal'' the object-linking H tone from the object.} I gloss this object-linking H tone as ``{\OBJ}.{\LINK}''. Thus, in \REF{LINK1}, the object receives an H tone, attaching to the noun class prefix, which is underlyingly toneless.

The English translation of this sentence is:`You [Nzambi's wife], stay first, we and her [the speaker's wife], we go to the fields.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Noun phrases that appear bare on the surface and express location and/or direction can also serve as obliques. In \REF{Lobj}, the verb {\itshape kɛ̀} `go', which is mostly intransitive, is followed by the location oblique {\itshape mánkɛ̃̂} `fields'. I propose that the H tone on {\itshape mánkɛ̃̂} `fields' stems from an assimilated locative preposition {\itshape ɛ́} (\sectref{sec:LOCe}), whose H tone survives on the noun class prefix.

You are a linguist specializing in Gyeli. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): tɔ̀sâ a nzí gyàga ___ H-be-fùmbí b-wánɔ̀
Gloss (with missing item): no 1 PROG.PST buy ___ OBJ.LINK-be8-orange ba2-child
The English translation of this sentence is:`[The woman bought oranges and beans for the children.{\textemdash}] No, she bought only oranges for the children.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: As a second function, {\itshape kɔ́ɔ̀} is also used for restricting information. Thus, the statement in \REF{koo3}, `The woman bought oranges and beans for the children' is corrected, noting that its gloss ___ oranges have been bought. In this case, the modifier precedes the constituent it modifies, namely {\itshape befùmbí} `oranges'. As \REF{koo3a} and \REF{koo3b} illustrate, the modifier always precedes the object noun phrase, no matter whether it occurs as first or second object.
A: word: mɛ̀-gà	 gloss: 1.SBJ-CONTR
B: word: sâ/kɔ́ɔ̀	 gloss: only
C: word: ndáà	 gloss: also
D: word: kɔ́ɔ̀	 gloss: SEQU

The English translation of this sentence is:`This Nzambi only gives a cry.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: \noindent What this example also shows is that the modifiers {\itshape the morpheme ___} and {\itshape sâ} can be used interchangeably in this context, namely whenever {\itshape the morpheme ___} expresses restriction. Also \REF{koo4} represents such a case. When Nzambi realizes that his family has been killed, he just cries (and does not do anything else).

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Another way of translating {\itshape the morpheme ___} into Cameroonian French is {\itshape toujours} `its gloss ___', which applies in examples such as \REF{koo6} and \REF{koo7}. In both cases, the function of {\itshape the morpheme ___} is to take up a previous discourse topic and re-introduce it.\footnote{An English translation with `just' also seems plausible and the exact difference between `just' and `its gloss ___' in these contexts is hard to grasp. Speakers, however, make a difference whether they use {\itshape seulement} `only' or {\itshape toujours} `its gloss ___' in their translations.}

The English translation of this sentence is:`Him here, he lives only from palm trees, these palm trees.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The primary function of the modifier {\itshape the morpheme ___} is restrictive, as already seen in \REF{koo3}. {\itshape the morpheme ___} seems to its gloss ___ have scope over single constituents in a clause rather than over the whole sentence. It immediately precedes the constituent that it modifies. In \REF{sa1}, for instance, {\itshape the morpheme ___} precedes the oblique noun phrase {\itshape nà màlɛ́ndí} `from palm trees'. In terms of its meaning, {\itshape the morpheme ___} restricts the interpretation to this noun phrase, i.e.\ Nzambi its gloss ___ lives from palm trees and no other crops.

The English translation of this sentence is:`Give me only your child that you have here.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In \REF{sa2}, the {\itshape the morpheme ___} restricts the object interpretation and thus precedes the object noun phrase {\itshape mwánɔ̀ wɔ́ɔ̀} `your child'.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: {\itshape the morpheme ___} can also modify adverbs, as in \REF{sa3}. The implicit contrast of the restriction is `here' as opposed to some other place. Thus, the speaker emphasizes that he stays its gloss ___ in the same place and does not go elsewhere so that his relatives are encouraged to join him in his village.

You are a linguist specializing in Gyeli. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ___ wɛ nyɛ̂-H nyɛ̂
Gloss (with missing item): ___ 2SG.PST1 see-R 1.OBJ
The English translation of this sentence is:`Did you see him?'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Prosody does not seem to play a role in terms of indicating a question. Therefore, question markers are the only means to mark questions clearly as such, especially in polar questions that do not employ any other question indicating devices, in contrast to constituent questions, which use interrogatives. Nevertheless, the use of question markers is not obligatory, not even in polar questions, as shown in \REF{Pits gloss ___3}. In this example, it has to be clear from the context, however, that the sentence is a question. Otherwise, {\itshape the morpheme ___} as in \REF{Pits gloss ___1} has to be used.
A: word: nà	 gloss: Q
B: word: ngáà	 gloss: Q(tag)

The English translation of this sentence is:`Did you see him?'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In addition to their syntactic function of marking a phrase as a question, question markers also have a pragmatic function. In contexts where it is clear that a phrase is meant as a question and {\itshape the morpheme ___} is still used, the question marker serves as marking emphasis. For instance, \REF{Pits gloss ___1} could also be translated as `Did you really see him?', just as in \REF{Pits gloss ___2}. Using the longer form {\itshape the morpheme ___nâ}, as in \REF{Pits gloss ___2}, is even more emphatic and indicates the speakers disbelief: speakers would also translate the question in \REF{Pits gloss ___2} as `Are you sure that you saw him?'
A: word: nà	 gloss: Q

The English translation of this sentence is:`I say that she [Nadine] ought to build me houses.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: While the previous examples could also have been expressed by possessive pronouns as modifiers to the noun, other possessor raising constructions are rather equivalent to benefactives. In \REF{PR4}, for example, the structure could be modified to `build houses for me' with a purpose or benefactive oblique phrase introduced by {\itshape púù yá} (see \sectref{sec:OBL}).

The English translation of this sentence is:`The people have all died here inside the house.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: As a counterpart to benefactive readings, possessor raising can also express adverse functions, as in \REF{PR6} where the speaker experiences a bad event. The construction is further special in terms of information structure, since the possessor object pronoun is fronted before the verb so that the verb appears in focus position (see \sectref{sec:OBJfront}). This shows that possessor objects indeed behave identical to other objects.

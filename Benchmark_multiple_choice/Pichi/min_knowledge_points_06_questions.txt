Question 50:
You are a linguist specializing in Pichi. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Since stative verbs have no inherent boundaries, the unmarked stative verb receives an imperfective, i.e. present tense or present state reading \REF{ex:key:315}. Tense is relational in Pichi, so a stative verb like the morpheme ___ ‘its gloss ___’ is in the present tense in relation to “event time” (\citealt{ChungTimberlake1985}), which is past tense in this example:
A: word: dɔ́n	 gloss: PRF
B: word: wántɛn	 gloss: suddenly
C: word: quiero	 gloss: I.want
D: word: wánt	 gloss: want
Please only return the letter (A–D). Do not say anything else.

Gloss (with missing item): 1SG.SBJ ___ some carpenter PL
The English translation of this sentence is:‘I know some carpenters.’ or ‘I got to know some carpenters.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Given the right context, all factative-marked inchoative-stative verbs may be interpreted as stative or inchoative (hence denoting entry-into-state). While the morpheme ___ ‘(get to) its gloss ___’ in \REF{ex:key:316} may be interpreted as either stative or inchoative in the absence of disambiguating cues, an inchoative reading is forced upon the factative marked verb évi ‘be heavy’ in \REF{ex:key:317}. This is due to the presence of a relational element, namely the temporal clause linker bifó ‘before’, which induces an implicit comparison with the prior empty state of the bag:
A: word: kúk	 gloss: cook
B: word: sabí	 gloss: know
C: word: entiende	 gloss: understand
D: word: bíl	 gloss: build

However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): E wɔ́nt ___ lɛkɛ in papá.
Gloss (with missing item): 3SG.SBJ want ___ like 3SG.POSS father
The English translation of this sentence is:‘She’s about to become as tall as her father.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: For example, \REF{ex:key:373} is uttered when the speaker looks at a photograph of a father and his daughter, who is very tall for her young age. A desire reading of wánt as ‘want to’ is conceivable if the morpheme ___ ‘be long, tall’ is seen as a property that can be controlled by the speaker (even if humorously). However, a prospective reading denoting imminence appears more reasonable. Note that the prospective aspect reading of wánt triggers an imminent entry-into-state interpretation of the inchoative-stative verb the morpheme ___ ‘be long, tall’:
A: word: sɛ́f	 gloss: self
B: word: ték=an	 gloss: take=3SG.OBJ
C: word: lɔ́n	 gloss: be.long
D: word: dɔ́n	 gloss: PRF

Question 158:
You are a linguist specializing in Pichi. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): A bin chɛ́k sé rén ___ fɔ́l.
Gloss (with missing item): 1SG.SBJ PST check QUOT rain ___ fall
The English translation of this sentence is:‘I thought it might rain.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In \REF{ex:key:375}, the main clause is also marked for past tense. This time, the subordinate clause (which begins with sé ‘\textsc{quot}’) is posterior to the main clause. Posteriority is expressed via the use of the potential marker the morpheme ___. Yet there is no additional past tense marking in the subordinate clause, and indeed, it would be ungrammatical. This in spite of the fact that both the main clause and the subordinate clause are set in the past from the vantage point of the speaker. Hence, the event in the main clause, not speech time, is the reference point for the tense assignment of the subordinate clause:
A: word: jɔ́ch	 gloss: judge
B: word: mɛ́mba	 gloss: think.of
C: word: go	 gloss: POT
D: word: golpe	 gloss: blow

Question 159:
You are a linguist specializing in Pichi. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ___ náyt wé a de kɔ́l yú, yɛ́stadé náyt, nɔ́ dís mɔ́nin náw.
Gloss (with missing item): ___ night SUB 1SG.SBJ IPFV call 2SG.INDP yesterday night NEG this morning now
The English translation of this sentence is:‘Yesterday night, when I was calling you, yesterday night, not this morning.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: A second manifestation of relational tense in Pichi is the absence of explicit tense marking whenever context offers enough information on tense anchoring. Contextual information may be provided by time adverbials as in \REF{ex:key:376}. Here, the morpheme ___ náyt ‘its gloss ___ night’ anchors time reference in the past. Consequently, the imperfective marked verb kɔ́l ‘call’ receives a present tense/simultaneous interpretation in relation to past tense anchoring. Further marking by bin is unnecessary, although possible (cf. \sectref{sec:6.5.2}):
A: word: nɛ́a	 gloss: NEG.PRF
B: word: tidé	 gloss: today
C: word: yɛ́s	 gloss: yes
D: word: yɛ́stadé	 gloss: yesterday
Please only return the letter (A–D). Do not say anything else.

Contextual information may be provithe morpheme ___d by time adverbials as in \REF{ex:key:376}. Here, yɛ́stadé náyt ‘yesterday night’ anchors time reference in the past. Consequently, the imperfective marked verb kɔ́l ‘call’ receives a present tense/simultaneous interpretation in relation to past tense anchoring. Further marking by bin is unnecessary, although possible (cf. \sectref{sec:6.5.2}):
A: word: cuaderno	 gloss: exercise.book

The English translation of this sentence is:‘One evening, I went out again, I went for a stroll, when I was arriving at the house, [I] hear Djunais [say that...].’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In \REF{ex:key:377}, past tense reference is established through the adverbial wán ívin tɛ́n ‘one evening’ and the factative marked, perfective, hence past tense dynamic verbs kɔmɔ́t ‘go out’ and gó ‘go’. The imperfective marked verb rích ‘arrive’ in the subsequent clause remains unspecified for tense and receives a simultaneous reading, once more in relation to the past tense anchoring provithe morpheme ___d by the preceding adverbial and factative-marked dynamic verbs:

The English translation of this sentence is:‘I passed through the entrance at the back, I went to look for a cigarette.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Two types of past tense expression exist in Pichi. The principal means of expressing past tense by default are factative marking (cf. e.g. \ref{ex:key:314}) and the use of the narrative perfective{\fff} marker kán ‘\textsc{pfv}’ (cf. \ref{ex:key:323}–\ref{ex:key:324}). With (inchoative-)stative verbs, factative TMA gives rise to present tense{\fff} reference by default. This is illustrated in \REF{ex:key:378} with the stative verb fíba ‘resemble’ and the inchoative-stative verbs lɛ́k ‘like’ and sabí ‘(get to) know’ in \REF{ex:key:378}.

The principal means of expressing past tense by default are factative marking (cf. e.g. \ref{ex:key:314}) and the use of the narrative perfective{\fff} marker kán ‘\textsc{pfv}’ (cf. \ref{ex:key:323}–\ref{ex:key:324}). With (inchoative-)stative verbs, factative TMA gives rise to present tense{\fff} reference by default. This is illustrated in \REF{ex:key:378} with the stative verb fíba ‘resemble’ and the inchoative-stative verbs the morpheme ___ ‘its gloss ___’ and sabí ‘(get to) know’ in \REF{ex:key:378}.
A: word: lɛ́k	 gloss: like
B: word: wók	 gloss: work
C: word: tan	 gloss: as
D: word: lɛ́k=an	 gloss: like=3SG.OBJ

Question 176:
You are a linguist specializing in Pichi. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ___ tɛ́n a dé fáyn.
Gloss (with missing item): ___ time 1SG.SBJ BE.LOC fine
The English translation of this sentence is:‘That time, I was fine.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Factative-marked stative verbs have a default present tense reference in relation to event time. Hence past tense reference can only be established for stative verbs by means of explicit past tense marking (i.e. via bin ‘\textsc{pst}’) or by means of contextual cues in the clause. In \REF{ex:key:380}, the time adverbial the morpheme ___ tɛ́n ‘its gloss ___ time’ anchors time reference in the past, so the stative copula dé is interpreted as simultaneous to this tense anchor:
A: word: dís	 gloss: this
B: word: dáns	 gloss: dance
C: word: ték	 gloss: take
D: word: dán	 gloss: that

You are a linguist specializing in Pichi. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): Mí bin dé dé, a bin ___ dásɔl, dís, a de mék} fínga dɛn, manicura.
Gloss (with missing item): 1SG.INDP PST BE.LOC there 1SG.SBJ PST ___ only this 1SG.SBJ IPFV make finger PL manicure
The English translation of this sentence is:‘(As for) me, (when) I was there, I only made, this, I used to make fingers, manicure.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Sentence \REF{ex:key:381} above is part of an orienting section of a narrative and provides background information to a story. The stative copula dé and the first dynamic verb (marked by superscript as \textsuperscript{1}mek ‘its gloss ___’) are overtly marked for past tense with bin. Once the use of bin with these two verbs has anchored the sentence (and in fact, the entire following narrative) in the past, overt past tense marking is unnecessary with subsequent verbs as is the case with the second dynamic verb (marked by superscript as \textsuperscript{2}mek in \ref{ex:key:381}).
A: word: mék=an	 gloss: make=3SG.OBJ
B: word: mék	 gloss: make

Sentence (with missing item): A ___ recupera smɔ́l.
Gloss (with missing item): 1SG.SBJ ___ recover small
The English translation of this sentence is:‘(Then) I recovered a bit.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The following extract illustrates the importance that the morpheme ___ ‘\textsc{pfv}’ has for organising the events of a paragraph with respect to narrative saliency. The verbs in (\ref{ex:key:460a}–d) are marked for perfective aspect due to the novel information they contain. Meanwhile, \REF{ex:key:460}\ (e) reiterates information already contained in \REF{ex:key:460}\ (c) and (d), therefore dispenses with perfective marking and is characterised by the presence of stative, narratively downshifted verbs:
A: word: llegue	 gloss: arrive:SBJV
B: word: fíba	 gloss: fever
C: word: kán	 gloss: PFV
D: word: “kán	 gloss: come

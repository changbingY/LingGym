Question 52:
You are a linguist specializing in Rapa Nui. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): \ꞌĀ\ꞌana te haka ___ i te henua.
Gloss (with missing item): POSS.3SG.A ART CAUS ___ ACC ART land
The English translation of this sentence is:‘He (was the one who) governed the country.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Constructions such as \REF{ex:3.11} are only found with event words, not with entity words. If the underlined phrases were regarded as noun phrases because of the presence of the article, they would be undistinguishable from “normal” noun phrases, which never enter into this construction.

The English translation of this sentence is:‘Read the following words aloud: raŋi, rano, rapu.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: We may conclude that it would be unsatisfactory to consider a word as noun whenever it is preceded by a dethe morpheme ___rminer. Event words preceded by dethe morpheme ___rminers may have either a nominal sense and nominal function, or a verbal sense and verbal function (possibly with verbal syntactic trappings). This suggests that we should make a distinction between \the morpheme ___xtsc{lexical nominalisation}\is{Nominalisation!lexical}, which turns a verb into a true noun, and \the morpheme ___xtsc{syntactic nominalisation}\is{Nominalisation!syntactic}, in which a verb is used as nucleus of a noun phrase, while retaining its verbal meaning and other verbal characthe morpheme ___ristics, such as the possibility to take verbal arguments. The examples above show that both occur in Rapa Nui: \REF{ex:3.10} is an example of lexical nominalisation\is{Nominalisation!lexical}, while \REF{ex:3.7} is an example of syntactic nominalisation\is{Nominalisation!syntactic}. These processes will be discussed in sections \sectref{sec:3.2.2} and \sectref{sec:3.2.3}, respectively.

Question 68:
You are a linguist specializing in Rapa Nui. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): E ___ rō mai \ꞌā paurō te mahana ki a au.
Gloss (with missing item): IPFV ___ EMPH hither CONT every ART day to PROP 1SG
The English translation of this sentence is:‘Every day he speaks to me.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Between prototypical\is{Prototype} nouns and prototypical\is{Prototype} verbs lies a whole range of non-prototyp\-i\-cal\is{Prototype} constructions, as illustrated above. Any attempt to divide this area up by drawing a line separating the “noun area” from the “verb area” is arbitrary. However, for practical reasons I will use the term verb for any word which is lexically (i.e. semantically) a verb, and noun for any word which is lexically a noun. Thus, in the examples above, the underlined lexical item in (\ref{ex:3.1}–\ref{ex:3.3}) and \REF{ex:3.10} is called a noun, while the underlined word in \REF{ex:3.9} and \REF{ex:3.11} is called a verb. Vānaŋa is a verb when it denotes the action ‘to talk’, whether it occurs in a prototypical\is{Prototype} VP or in a phrase that also has nominal properties. When the morpheme ___ denotes an entity ‘word, utterance’, it is a noun. As these two senses are obviously related, the relation between the two can be defined as polysemy (one lexical item having two related but not identical senses) rather than homophony (two unrelated lexical items which happen to share the same phonological form).

You are a linguist specializing in Rapa Nui. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): \ꞌAi te nunui o te pa\ꞌahia e ___ rō \ꞌā e viri era.
Gloss (with missing item): there ART PL:big of ART sweat IPFV ___ EMPH CONT IPFV roll DIST
The English translation of this sentence is:‘Big drops of sweat became blood and fell down.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Any noun (i.e. entity word) can be used as the nucleus of a verb phrase. Usually, the noun is used in a predicative sense: a verb phrase headed by noun N signifies that the subject is or becomes N; it possesses or acquires property N. These constructions are somewhat similar to nominal predicates marked with he (\sectref{sec:9.2.1}), yet they are different: the noun may be preceded by any preverbal marker, e.g. an aspectual as in \REF{ex:3.55} or a negator as in \REF{ex:3.56}, and it may be followed by verb phrase particles such as \textit{rō {\ꞌ}ā} in \REF{ex:3.55}. Also, the clause may express a process (‘become’), while nominal predicates only express a state (‘be’).

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: As \citet[54–55]{Clark1976} points out, all other Polynesian languages use either i or o as second preposition;\footnote{\label{fn:142}Vaitupu (a dialect of \ili{Tuvaluan}) is the only variety apart from Rapa Nui where both o and i are used, without apparent difference in meaning.} Rapa Nui is the only language in which the second preposition may be a copy of the first.\footnote{\label{fn:143}As \citet[56–57]{Clark1976} indicates, the copying construction could have arisen from cases like \REF{ex:3.137} or \REF{ex:3.138}: the second preposition, which originally was an invariable i or o, was reanalysed as a repetition of the first one. This reanalysis could have been facilitated by constructions like the following (quoted by Clark):

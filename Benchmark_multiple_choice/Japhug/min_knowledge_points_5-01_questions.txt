Question 76:
You are a linguist specializing in Japhug. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): [xɕiri nɯ ___ qapri bɯxsi pjɤ-sat kɯ-ŋu] nɯnɯ ko-tso
Gloss (with missing item): weasel DEM ___ snake python IFR-kill SBJ:PCP-be DEM IFR-understand
The English translation of this sentence is:`He realized that it was the weasel that had killed the python.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The postverbal copula can be nominalized, and the whole sentence turned into a non-finite clause. This type of construction is also used for constituent focalization as in (\ref{ex:qapri.bWxsi.pjAsat}). The form \forme{the morpheme ___-ŋu} is ambiguous between a stative infinitive and a subject participle (§\ref{sec:infinitives.participles}), and therefore the non-finite clause is either analyzable as an infinitival complement clause (§\ref{sec:inf.complementation}) or a participial clause in semi-object function (§\ref{sec:relative.core.arg}).
A: word: jla	 gloss: hybrid.yak
B: word: kɯ	 gloss: ERG
C: word: qʰoʁqʰoʁ	 gloss: ingot
D: word: a-tɤ-kɯ-nɯlaʁrdaβ-a	 gloss: IRR-PFV-2\fl{}1-hit.with.forelegs-1SG

Question 77:
You are a linguist specializing in Japhug. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): nɯ kɯ-fse ci tɯ-ŋu, nɯ mɤ-kɯ-naχtɕɯɣ ci ___ tɯ-ŋu
Gloss (with missing item): DEM SBJ:PCP-be.like INDEF 2-be:FACT DEM NEG-SBJ:PCP-be.the.same INDEF ___ 2-be:FACT
The English translation of this sentence is:`You are (someone) like that, you are different (from normal people).'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Copulas are exceptional in being the only verbs that can be repeated to express emphasis. This usage is only found in the traditional story register, as in (\ref{ex:tWNu.tWNu}). This construction differs from partial reduplication, which only targets one syllable (§\ref{sec:partial.redp}).
A: word: pjɤ-tɯ-ŋu	 gloss: IFR.IPFV-2-be
B: word: pɤnmawombɤr	 gloss: ANTHR
C: word: tɯ-ŋu	 gloss: 2-be:FACT
D: word: ŋu/tɯ-ŋu	 gloss: be:FACT/2-be:FACT

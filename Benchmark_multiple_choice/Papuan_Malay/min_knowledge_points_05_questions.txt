Sentence (with missing item): bapa nanti ___ hadir di ini retrit pemuda
Gloss (with missing item): father very.soon ___ attend at D.PROX retreat youth
The English translation of this sentence is:[About an event planned for the next year:] ‘you (‘father’) (have to) attend, what’s-its-name, the youth retreat next year’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Within the clause, the relative-time denoting expressions typically occur in clause-initial position. Here they set the temporal stage for the entire clause, similar to the nouns denoting periods of the day, discussed in §\ref{Para_5.2.5.2}. This is illustrated with the examples in (\ref{Example_5.83}) to (\ref{Example_5.85}). Alternatively, but less often, the relative-time expressions directly precede the predicate where they are less prominent, as shown in (\ref{Example_5.86}). The contrast in meaning conveyed by the different positions within the clause is illustrated with \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’ in the near contrastive examples in (\ref{Example_5.85}) and (\ref{Example_5.86}). By fronting \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’ in (\ref{Example_5.85}), the speaker accentuates the temporal setting of the entire clause. This is not the case in (\ref{Example_5.86}), where \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’ directly precedes the predicate, where it is less salient.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The prepredicate position of the focus adverbs is illustrated in (\ref{Example_5.177}) to (\ref{Example_5.181}). Focus adverbs typically precede the subject. This is shown with \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’ in (\ref{Example_5.177}) and \textitbf{hanya} ‘only’ in (\ref{Example_5.179}). Most of them can also take a prepredicate position directly preceding the predicate; the exceptions are \textitbf{apalagi} ‘moreover’, \textitbf{kecuali} ‘except’ and \textitbf{kususnya} ‘especially’ which always precede the subject. The position directly preceding the predicate is shown with \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’ in (\ref{Example_5.178}) and \textitbf{hanya} ‘only’ in (\ref{Example_5.180}), respectively.

These examples also illustrate that focus adverbs not only modify verbal predicates, as in (\ref{Example_5.177}), and (\ref{Example_5.179}) to (\ref{Example_5.181}), but also nonverbal predicates, such as the \isi{numeral} predicate \textitbf{dua} ‘two’ in (\ref{Example_5.178}).

Gloss (with missing item): ... be.soaked at water ___
The English translation of this sentence is:[About a motorbike that got stuck in a river:] ‘[(the motorbike) is still there ...,] (it) is immersed in water continuously’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Papuan Malay does not have manner adverbs. Instead, manner is expressed through stative verbs, as shown in (\ref{Example_5.195}) to (\ref{Example_5.200}). The modifying stative verbs always take a postpredicate position. In (\ref{Example_5.195}), for instance, postpredicate stative \textitbf{kras} ‘be harsh’ modifies stative \textitbf{sakit} ‘be sick’, and in (\ref{Example_5.198}) \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘be continuous’ modifies \textitbf{tatap dia} ‘observe him’. In verbal clauses with peripheral adjuncts, the modifying stative \isi{verb} can directly follow the predicate as in (\ref{Example_5.199}), or follow the adjunct, as in (\ref{Example_5.200}).
A: word: petrus	 gloss: Petrus
B: word: trus	 gloss: be.continuous
C: word: masi	 gloss: still
D: word: timur	 gloss: east

Constituents occurring to the right of the demonstratives such as \textitbf{liar} ‘be wild’ in (\ref{Example_5.206}) are not part of the \isi{noun} phrase: \textitbf{liar} ‘be wild’ is a clausal predicate.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Locatives are always embedded in prepositional phrases. The \isi{prepositional phrase} can be a peripheral adjunct, as in the first clause in (\ref{Example_5.223}) or in (\ref{Example_5.225}), a prepositional predicate, as in the second clause in (\ref{Example_5.223}), or an adnominal \isi{prepositional phrase}, as in (\ref{Example_5.224}). Usually, the locatives are introduced with an overt \isi{preposition} as in (\ref{Example_5.223}) or (\ref{Example_5.224}). The \isi{preposition} may, however, also be elided as in (\ref{Example_5.225}): the omitted \isi{preposition} is allative \textitbf{ke} ‘to’ (the \isi{elision} of prepositions is discussed in §\ref{Para_10.1.5}).

Sentence (with missing item): ___ su gigit sa pu lutut
Gloss (with missing item): ___ already bite 1SG POSS knee
The English translation of this sentence is:‘what has bitten my knee?’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In its pronominal uses, \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’ occurs in all syntactic positions, as demonstrated in (\ref{Example_5.246}) to (\ref{Example_5.251}), always remaining in-situ. In the elicited \isi{verbal clause} in (\ref{Example_5.246}), \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’ takes the subject slot. While this construction is grammatically correct and acceptable, verbal clauses with \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’ in the subject slot are unattested in the corpus.

The English translation of this sentence is:‘how many children do you (‘father’) have?’ (Lit. ‘father’s children are how many?’)

Again, the fronting of the \isi{interrogative} serves to emphasize the questioning, namely of numeric quantities in (\ref{Example_5.287}), and of nonnumeric quantities in (\ref{Example_5.289}). These two examples are elicited, though, as interrogatives with fronted \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___, how many’ are unattested in the corpus.

The English translation of this sentence is:‘(there) is a certain younger sibling there’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In addition to its enumerating function in postposed position, adnominally used \textitbf{satu} ‘one’ is employed to encode “specific \isi{indefiniteness}”, using Crystal’s (\citeyear*[444]{Crystal.2008}) terminology. That is, in \textsc{nn}um-\textsc{np}s adnominal \textitbf{satu} ‘one’ denotes specific but nonidentifiable referents, giving the specific \isi{indefinite} reading \textscItal{n} \textitbf{satu} ‘a certain \textsc{n}’. The specific \isi{indefinite} referent may be animate human such as \textitbf{the morpheme ___ satu} ‘a certain younger sibling’ in (\ref{Example_5.312}) or inanimate such as \textitbf{kampung satu} ‘a certain village’ in (\ref{Example_5.313}).

Sentence (with missing item): ___ jam
Gloss (with missing item): ___ hour
The English translation of this sentence is:‘half an hour’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Noun phrases with adnominal quantifiers have syntactic properties similar to those with adnominal numerals, as illustrated in (\ref{Example_5.314}) to (\ref{Example_5.322}). Noun phrases with prehead quantifiers (``\textsc{q}t\textsc{n-np}'') express nonnumeric amounts or quantities of the items indicated by their head nominals. Thereby, the composite nature of countable referents is accentuated. Posthead quantifiers, by contrast, may denote exhaustivity of \isi{indefinite} referents or signal unknown positions within series or sequences; they modify countable as well as uncountable referents.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The data in (\ref{Example_5.314}) to (\ref{Example_5.322}) shows that not all quantifiers occur in all positions. Only five quantifiers occur in either pre- or posthead position, namely \textitbf{banyak} ‘many’, \textitbf{brapa} ‘several’, \textitbf{masing-masing} ‘each’, \textitbf{sedikit} ‘few’, and \textitbf{smua} ‘all’. While \textitbf{banyak} ‘many’, \textitbf{sedikit} ‘few’, and \textitbf{smua} ‘all’ can modify both count and mass nouns, \textitbf{brapa} ‘several’ and \textitbf{masing-masing} ‘each’ only modify count nouns. The remaining four quantifiers occur in prehead position only, namely \textitbf{segala} ‘all’, \textitbf{sembarang} ‘any (kind of)’, \textitbf{(se)tiap} ‘every’, and \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’.

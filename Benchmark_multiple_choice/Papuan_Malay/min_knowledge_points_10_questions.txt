Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): saya tidor ___ sore
Gloss (with missing item): 1SG sleep ___ afternoon
The English translation of this sentence is:‘I slept until the afternoon’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Typically, peripheral prepositional phrases can be moved to other positions within the clause with no change in meaning. This does not, however, apply to the example in (\ref{Example_10.19}). When the \isi{prepositional phrase} is moved to the front it denotes the temporal starting rather than the temporal endpoint of \textitbf{tidor} ‘sleep’, as in (\ref{Example_10.20}). Hence, the meaning changes to ‘come afternoon’ (literally ‘reaches the afternoon’). One initial explanation for this change in meaning is that the utterance in (\ref{Example_10.20}) expresses a sequence of two events, namely the \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘reaching’ of the afternoon and subsequently the \textitbf{tidor} ‘sleeping’. In that case, \textitbf{the morpheme ___ sore} does not express the \isi{prepositional phrase} ‘its gloss ___ afternoon’ but the \isi{verbal clause} ‘reached the afternoon’ or ‘come afternoon’. This explanation, however, requires further investigation.

Question 50:
You are a linguist specializing in Papuan Malay. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ___ sore saya tidor
Gloss (with missing item): ___ afternoon 1SG sleep
The English translation of this sentence is:‘come afternoon I slept’ (Lit. ‘reach the afternoon’)
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Typically, peripheral prepositional phrases can be moved to other positions within the clause with no change in meaning. This does not, however, apply to the example in (\ref{Example_10.19}). When the \isi{prepositional phrase} is moved to the front it denotes the temporal starting rather than the temporal endpoint of \textitbf{tidor} ‘sleep’, as in (\ref{Example_10.20}). Hence, the meaning changes to ‘come afternoon’ (literally ‘its gloss ___es the afternoon’). One initial explanation for this change in meaning is that the utterance in (\ref{Example_10.20}) expresses a sequence of two events, namely the \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___ing’ of the afternoon and subsequently the \textitbf{tidor} ‘sleeping’. In that case, \textitbf{the morpheme ___ sore} does not express the \isi{prepositional phrase} ‘until afternoon’ but the \isi{verbal clause} ‘its gloss ___ed the afternoon’ or ‘come afternoon’. This explanation, however, requires further investigation.

In that case, \textitbf{sampe the morpheme ___} does not express the \isi{prepositional phrase} ‘until its gloss ___’ but the \isi{verbal clause} ‘reached the its gloss ___’ or ‘come its gloss ___’.

You are a linguist specializing in Papuan Malay. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): smua jalang kaya kapal ___
Gloss (with missing item): all walk like ship ___
The English translation of this sentence is:‘[because they were so hungry] (they) all were strolling around like wooden boats’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Most commonly, \textitbf{kaya} ‘like’ forms peripheral adjuncts, as in \textitbf{kaya burung} ‘like a bird’ in (\ref{Example_10.73}). This example also illustrates that \textitbf{kaya} ‘like’ co-occurs with some of the same verbs as \textitbf{sperti} ‘similar to’, such as \textitbf{terbang} ‘fly’ in (\ref{Example_10.68}) (§\ref{Para_10.3.1}). Less frequently, \textitbf{kaya} ‘like’ introduces the simile in nonverbal predicates as in \textitbf{kaya buaya} ‘like a crocodile’ in (\ref{Example_10.74}). These examples also illustrate that typically the referent is animate and nominal; for an inanimate referent see the example in (\ref{Example_10.77}), and for a pronominal referent see (\ref{Example_10.76b}).

Employing \textitbf{sperti} ‘similar to’, the teacher signals that she refers to some specific aspects of the student’s behavior: \textitbf{kalo kaka sperti the morpheme ___} ‘if I (‘older sibling’) were similar to you (with respect to the behavior you’re displaying at school)’.

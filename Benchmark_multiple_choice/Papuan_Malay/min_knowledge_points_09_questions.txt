Question 19:
You are a linguist specializing in Papuan Malay. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): de timbul de=p ___ tanya dia, tete knapa
Gloss (with missing item): 3SG emerge 3SG=POSS ___ ask 3SG grandfather why
The English translation of this sentence is:‘(when) he (grandfather) emerged, his grandchild asked him, ``grandfather, what happened?'''
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The possessive marker can be reduced further to \textitbf{=p} ‘\textsc{poss}’, if the \isi{possessor \isi{noun} phrase} ends in a vowel, as in (\ref{Example_9.9}) to (\ref{Example_9.11}). In this case, the marker is cliticized to the possessor. In this type of reduced possessive construction, the possessor is almost always a singular personal \isi{pronoun}, such as short first person \textitbf{sa} ‘\textsc{1sg}’, second person \textitbf{ko} ‘\textsc{2sg}’ in (\ref{Example_9.9}), or short third person \textitbf{de} ‘\textsc{3sg}’ as in (\ref{Example_9.10}). The possessor may, however, also be expressed by a \isi{noun} as in (\ref{Example_9.11}), although in the corpus this example is the only one attested. Again, the same construction is used for alienable and inalienable possession.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In `\textsc{possessor} \textitbf{punya}’ constructions, speakers most commonly employ long \textitbf{punya} ‘\textsc{poss}’, but as shown in (\ref{Example_9.30}) and (\ref{Example_9.31}), constructions with reduced \textitbf{pu} ‘\textsc{poss}’ are also possible.\footnote{In their analysis of similar possessive constructions in Classical Malay, \citet[157]{Yap.2004} conclude that Classical Malay \textitbf{(em)punya} constructions with omitted possessum denote “pronominal possessive constructions”. More specifically, \citet[7]{Yap.2007} maintains that “in such constructions (em)punya identifies a possessee in relation to its possessor (the genitive function), while at the same time alluding to the morphologically unrealized possessee as well (the pronominal function). Consequently, possessive pronominal (em)punya allows us to focus on the possessor, while still referring to the possessee”. It seems that this analysis is also applicable to Papuan Malay.} Elision of the possessor is unattested. Instead speakers employ a \isi{demonstrative}, as in (\ref{Example_9.19}), when the identity of the possessor has already been established.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In `\textsc{possessor} \textitbf{punya}’ constructions, speakers most commonly employ long \textitbf{punya} ‘\textsc{poss}’, but as shown in (\ref{Example_9.30}) and (\ref{Example_9.31}), constructions with reduced \textitbf{pu} ‘\textsc{poss}’ are also possible.\footnote{In their analysis of similar possessive constructions in Classical Malay, \citet[157]{Yap.2004} conclude that Classical Malay \textitbf{(em)punya} constructions with omitted possessum denote “pronominal possessive constructions”. More specifically, \citet[7]{Yap.2007} maintains that “in such constructions (em)punya identifies a possessee in relation to its possessor (the genitive function), while at the same time alluding to the morphologically unrealized possessee as well (the pronominal function). Consequently, possessive pronominal (em)punya allows us to focus on the possessor, while still referring to the possessee”. It seems that this analysis is also applicable to Papuan Malay.} Elision of the possessor is unattested. Instead speakers employ a \isi{demonstrative}, as in (\ref{Example_9.19}), when the identity of the possessor has already been established.

Typically, explicit reflexive expressions are formed with a reflexive \isi{pronoun} “which refers to the same person or thing as the subject of the \isi{verb}” \citep[5165]{Asher.1994}. As Papuan Malay does not have reflexive pronouns, an alternative strategy is used. Reflexive relations are expressed with an \isi{adnominal possessive construction} where a personal \isi{pronoun} in the possessor slot and the reflexive \isi{noun} \textitbf{diri} ‘self’ in the possessum slot express the reflexive relationship between both, as illustrated with \textitbf{sa pu diri} ‘myself’ in (\ref{Example_9.57}) and \textitbf{kita the morpheme ___ diri} ‘ourselves’ in (\ref{Example_9.58}).
A: word: tanya	 gloss: ask
B: word: punya	 gloss: POSS
C: word: ruma	 gloss: house
D: word: hendro	 gloss: POSSR

Question 302:
You are a linguist specializing in Papuan Malay. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): kita rencana, manusia yang mengatur kita punya ___
Gloss (with missing item): 1PL plan human.being REL arrange 1PL POSS ___
The English translation of this sentence is:‘we make plans, (it’s us) human beings who manage our own lives’ (Lit. ‘the self of us’)
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The possessive marker \textitbf{punya} ‘\textsc{poss}’ is also used to create reflexive expressions. Generally speaking, reflexives designate constructions “where subject and object refer to the same entity, explicitly [{\ldots}] or implicitly” \citep[5164]{Asher.1994}. Typically, explicit reflexive expressions are formed with a reflexive \isi{pronoun} “which refers to the same person or thing as the subject of the \isi{verb}” \citep[5165]{Asher.1994}. As Papuan Malay does not have reflexive pronouns, an alternative strategy is used. Reflexive relations are expressed with an \isi{adnominal possessive construction} where a personal \isi{pronoun} in the possessor slot and the reflexive \isi{noun} \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’ in the possessum slot express the reflexive relationship between both, as illustrated with \textitbf{sa pu the morpheme ___} ‘myits gloss ___’ in (\ref{Example_9.57}) and \textitbf{kita punya the morpheme ___} ‘ourselves’ in (\ref{Example_9.58}).
A: word: diri	 gloss: self
B: word: makang	 gloss: eat
C: word: sendiri	 gloss: be.alone
D: word: bli	 gloss: buy

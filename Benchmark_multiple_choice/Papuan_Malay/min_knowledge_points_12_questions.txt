Question 65:
You are a linguist specializing in Papuan Malay. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): di langit ini bulang ___ tapi di kalender de dua blas
Gloss (with missing item): at sky D.PROX month ___ but at calendar 3SG two teens
The English translation of this sentence is:‘in this sky there is one moon, but in the calendar there are twelve’ (Lit. ‘the moon (is) one ... it (is) twelve’)
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In (\ref{Example_12.18}), a husband relates that in a neighboring village a woman gave birth to a snake. His wife contradicts this statement, asserting that it was not its gloss ___ snake but that the \textitbf{ular} ‘snake’ were \textitbf{dua} ‘two’. The analysis of the \textitbf{dua} ‘two’ as a \isi{numeral} predicate and not as an adnominal modifier is confirmed by the following fact. In the context of these utterances it is possible to insert existential \textitbf{ada} ‘exist’ between the subject \textitbf{ular} ‘snake’ and the predicate \textitbf{dua} ‘two’ which gives the emphatic progressive reading \textitbf{ular ada dua} ‘the snakes were being two’ or ‘the snakes were indeed two’ (see also §\ref{Para_5.4.1}). If \textitbf{ular dua} was a \isi{noun} phrase with the reading of ‘two snakes’, existential \textitbf{ada} ‘exist’ would have to precede or follow the \isi{noun} phrase such that \textitbf{ada ular dua} ‘there were two snakes’ or \textitbf{ular dua ada} ‘the two snakes exist’. In (\ref{Example_12.19}), predicatively used \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’ and \textitbf{dua blas} ‘twelve’ convey information about the numeric quantities of their respective subjects \textitbf{bulang} ‘moon’ and \textitbf{de} ‘3\textsc{sg}’. The first clause \textitbf{di langit ini bulang the morpheme ___} cannot be interpreted as a \isi{prepositional predicate clause} (see §\ref{Para_12.4}) in which \textitbf{bulang the morpheme ___} functions as a \isi{noun} phrase which takes the subject slot. Such a reading would imply that there are several moons with the speaker talking about its gloss ___ of them: \textitbf{bulang the morpheme ___} ‘a certain moon’ (see §\ref{Para_5.9.4} for a more detailed discussion of \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’).

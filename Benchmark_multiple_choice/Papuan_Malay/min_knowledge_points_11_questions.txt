Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: If speakers want to emphasize the predicate with a \isi{monovalent} stative \isi{verb}, they can front it, such as stative \textitbf{bagus} ‘be good’ in ({\ref{Example_11.3}). In this case, the predicate is set-off by a boundary intonation, which is achieved by marking the stressed syllable of the \isi{verb} with a slight increase in pitch (“~\'{~}~”). Consultants disagree, however, whether \isi{monovalent} dynamic verbs can be fronted. While two consultants stated that dynamic \textitbf{jatu} ‘fall’ in the elicited example in ({\ref{Example_11.4}) can be fronted, a third one rejected the example as ungrammatical. Furthermore, one of the consultants who accepted the \isi{verbal clause} in ({\ref{Example_11.4}) suggested that the fronting of \isi{monovalent} dynamic verbs is a recent development and that older Papuan Malay speakers would not use such a construction.

Unlike clauses with preposed \isi{monovalent} verbs, though, there is no clear boundary intonation to set-off the preposed object arguments from the rest of the clause. In ({\ref{Example_11.9}), the preposed object \textitbf{paylot} ‘pilot’ is marked with a slight increase in pitch of its stressed penultimate syllable (“~\'{~}~”) and it is separated from the rest of the clause with a \isi{comma intonation} (“{\textbar}”). Besides, the ultimate syllable of \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’ receives final \isi{lengthening}, signaled with the vowel tripling. In ({\ref{Example_11.10}), the preposed object remains unmarked but the clause-final \isi{verb} \textitbf{potong} ‘cut’ is marked with a slight increase in pitch of its stressed penultimate syllable.

Sometimes, however, the reading of a \isi{causative} is ambiguous, as in ({\ref{Example_11.59}). If the causee \textitbf{Dodo} is unconscious out of fear and thereby helpless, the \isi{causative} receives the directive reading ‘remove’.

Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ... tapi dong kasi bangkit dia lagi, ___ hidup dia
Gloss (with missing item): ... but 3PL give be.resurrected 3SG again ___ live 3SG
The English translation of this sentence is:[About sorcerers who can resurrect the dead:] ‘[he’s already (dead),] but they resurrect him again, make him live’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In causatives with \isi{monovalent} non-agentive bases, as in ({\ref{Example_11.52}) to ({\ref{Example_11.55}), the causer controls the event while the causee has no control. Hence, these causatives always receive a directive reading. Likewise, causatives with \isi{monovalent} agentive bases receive a directive reading when the causee is inanimate, or animate but helpless. This is the case in ({\ref{Example_11.57}) and ({\ref{Example_11.58}). When, by contrast, the causee has some level of control, as in ({\ref{Example_11.56}), the causation is less direct; hence, the \isi{causative} receives an assistive reading. Sometimes, however, the reading of a \isi{causative} is ambiguous, as in ({\ref{Example_11.59}). If the causee \textitbf{Dodo} is unconscious out of fear and thereby helpless, the \isi{causative} receives the directive reading ‘remove’. But if \textitbf{Dodo} is conscious and can move, the \isi{causative} receives the assistive reading ‘enable to come out’.

Sentence (with missing item): ... tapi dong kasi bangkit dia lagi, kasi ___ dia
Gloss (with missing item): ... but 3PL give be.resurrected 3SG again give ___ 3SG
The English translation of this sentence is:[About sorcerers who can resurrect the dead:] ‘[he’s already (dead),] but they resurrect him again, make him live’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \isi{causative} in ({\ref{Example_11.62}), for example, is formed with non-agentive stative \textitbf{pusing} ‘be dizzy, be confused’. The use of \textitbf{biking} ‘make’ stresses the manipulating behavior of the causer \textitbf{ana{\Tilde}ana} ‘children’ which leads to the effect \textitbf{pusing} ‘be worried’; the causee \textitbf{mama} ‘mother’ has no control. The elicited examples in ({\ref{Example_11.63}) and ({\ref{Example_11.64}) contrast with the corresponding \textitbf{kasi}{}-causatives in ({\ref{Example_11.54}) and ({\ref{Example_11.55}). They show that \textitbf{biking}{}-causatives are also formed with \isi{monovalent} non-agentive dynamic bases, such as \textitbf{gugur} ‘abort’ or \textitbf{tenggelam} ‘sink’, respectively. Again, the manipulation itself is stressed. The base can also be agentive dynamic if the causee is animate but helpless. This is illustrated with the elicited example in ({\ref{Example_11.65}), which contrasts with the corresponding \textitbf{kasi}{}-\isi{causative} in ({\ref{Example_11.57}). The base is agentive dynamic \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’ but the animate causee is helpless and therefore has no control.
A: word: hidup	 gloss: live
B: word: tinggal	 gloss: stay
C: word: siduasi	 gloss: Siduas
D: word: tikus-tana	 gloss: spiny.bandicoot

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Causatives with agentive bases are unacceptable.

The English translation of this sentence is:‘it got to the point that we and the lecturer were arguing constantly with each other’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Cross-linguistically, the \isi{reciprocity marker} is classified in different ways; in some languages it is classified as a \isi{pronoun} or an ad\isi{verb}, in others as an affix or an auxiliary (see \citeauthor{Nedjalkov.2007b}'s \citeyear*[9–16]{Nedjalkov.2007b} above-mentioned distinction of syntactic and morphological reciprocals). As for the Papuan Malay \isi{reciprocity marker}, this grammar analyzes \textitbf{baku} ‘\textsc{recp}’ as an independent word and not as an affix, without, however, further specifying its morphosyntactic status at this point. This analysis as a separate word is based on the fact that \textitbf{baku} ‘\textsc{recp}’ can be reduplicated, as shown in ({\ref{Example_11.76}). Affixes, by contrast, are not reduplicated in Papuan Malay, as discussed in §\ref{Para_4.1}.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Most reciprocal constructions in the corpus (86/101 – 85%) are “simple reciprocals”. In such a construction, both participants are encoded as the clausal subject, which is called the “reciprocator”, following \citegen[2092]{Haspelmath.2007} terminology.\footnote{\citet[6]{Nedjalkov.2007b} uses the term “reciprocant” rather than “reciprocator”.} Hence, the typical structure for simple reciprocals is ``\textsc{reciprocator} \textitbf{the morpheme ___} \textsc{v}'', as shown in ({\ref{Example_11.77}) to ({\ref{Example_11.85}). The reciprocator can be a coordinate \isi{noun} phrase such as \textitbf{nona{\Tilde}nona ana laki{\Tilde}laki} ‘the girls (and) boys’ in ({\ref{Example_11.77}), or a plural personal \isi{pronoun} such as \textitbf{kamu} ‘\textsc{2pl}’ in ({\ref{Example_11.78}).

In such a construction, both participants are encoded as the clausal subject, which is called the “reciprocator”, following \citegen[2092]{Haspelmath.2007} terminology.\footnote{\citet[6]{Nedjalkov.2007b} uses the term “reciprocant” rather than “reciprocator”.} Hence, the typical structure for simple reciprocals is ``\textsc{reciprocator} \textitbf{the morpheme ___} \textsc{v}'', as shown in ({\ref{Example_11.77}) to ({\ref{Example_11.85}). The reciprocator can be a coordinate \isi{noun} phrase such as \textitbf{nona{\Tilde}nona ana laki{\Tilde}laki} ‘the girls (and) boys’ in ({\ref{Example_11.77}), or a plural personal \isi{pronoun} such as \textitbf{kamu} ‘\textsc{2pl}’ in ({\ref{Example_11.78}).

You are a linguist specializing in Papuan Malay. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ke mari, ada ___
Gloss (with missing item): to hither exist ___
The English translation of this sentence is:‘(come) here, there’s cooked rice’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In existential clauses with \isi{indefinite} or nonidentifiable themes, fronted \textitbf{ada} ‘exist’ has two functions, as shown in ({\ref{Example_11.98}) and ({\ref{Example_11.99}). One is to convey the existence of an entity, such that ``a \textsc{theme} exists'', as in ({\ref{Example_11.98}), where \textitbf{ada} ‘exist’ signals the existence of \textitbf{babi} ‘pig’. A second function is to signal availability in the sense of ``a \textsc{theme} is available'', as in ({\ref{Example_11.99}), where \textitbf{ada} ‘exist’ asserts the availability of \textitbf{kuskus} ‘cuscus’ and other game; see also the example in ({\ref{Example_11.96}).

The clause in ({\ref{Example_11.102}) asserts the known existence of \textitbf{the morpheme ___ pu motor} ‘its gloss ___’s motorbike’. In this \isi{adnominal possessive construction}, the \isi{possessor \isi{noun} phrase} \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’ modifies the identifiable \isi{possessum \isi{noun} phrase} \textitbf{motor} ‘motorbike’; both constituents are linked with the possessive marker \textitbf{pu} ‘\textsc{poss}’. The same applies to the clause in ({\ref{Example_11.103}) which signals possession of the \isi{definite} \isi{possessum \isi{noun} phrase} \textitbf{dana} ‘funds’. (Adnominal possessive relations are discussed in detail in \chapref{Para_9}. Possession of an \isi{indefinite} possessum is expressed with a \isi{two-argument existential clause} or with a nominal clause, as described in §\ref{Para_11.4.2} and §\ref{Para_12.2}, respectively.)

Sentence (with missing item): de ___ di situ, Martina ada di situ
Gloss (with missing item): 3SG ___ at L.MED Martina exist at L.MED
The English translation of this sentence is:‘she was (being) there, Martina was (being) there’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Definite or identifiable its gloss ___ential clauses also co-occur with prepositional phrases, such as the \isi{locational} phrase \textitbf{di situ} ‘there’ in ({\ref{Example_11.105}). This clause can be analyzed in two ways. One analysis is that of an \isi{its gloss ___ential clause} with a \isi{locational} adjunct which gives additional information about the theme’s current location. This analysis is substantiated by the contrastive example in ({\ref{Example_11.106}), in which \textitbf{situ} ‘\textsc{l.med}’ is fronted to the clause-initial position. This possibility of fronting the \isi{prepositional phrase} is typical for adjuncts. In ({\ref{Example_11.106}) the fronting serves to emphasize the location (concerning the rather common \isi{elision} of \isi{locative} \textitbf{di} ‘at’, see §\ref{Para_10.1.5}). An alternative analysis of ({\ref{Example_11.105}) is that of a \isi{prepositional predicate clause} with progressive reading. This analysis is substantiated with the (near) contrastive examples in ({\ref{Example_11.107}) to ({\ref{Example_11.109}). The example in ({\ref{Example_11.107}) presents a non\isi{verbal clause} in which \textitbf{di situ} ‘there’ serves as the predicate. The example in ({\ref{Example_11.108}) shows how a \isi{prepositional predicate clause} can undergo aspectual \isi{modification}, as for instance with the prospective ad\isi{verb} \textitbf{masi} ‘still’. The example in ({\ref{Example_11.109}) shows the progressive-marking function of its gloss ___ential \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’ in verbal clauses (see also §\ref{Para_5.4.1}). When presented with both analyses, however, one of the consultants rejected the first analysis. Instead this consultant maintained that \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’ in ({\ref{Example_11.105}) has the same function as \textitbf{masi} ‘still’ in ({\ref{Example_11.108}), namely to modify the prepositional predicate \textitbf{di situ} ‘there’. The two analyses and the reading chosen by one of the consultants for the clauses in ({\ref{Example_11.105}) require further investigation.

The example in ({\ref{Example_11.108}) shows how a \isi{prepositional predicate clause} can undergo aspectual \isi{modification}, as for instance with the prospective ad\isi{verb} \textitbf{masi} ‘still’. The example in ({\ref{Example_11.109}) shows the progressive-marking function of existential \textitbf{ada} ‘exist’ in verbal clauses (see also §\ref{Para_5.4.1}). When presented with both analyses, however, one of the consultants rejected the first analysis. Instead this consultant maintained that \textitbf{ada} ‘exist’ in ({\ref{Example_11.105}) has the same function as \textitbf{masi} ‘still’ in ({\ref{Example_11.108}), namely to modify the prepositional predicate \textitbf{di the morpheme ___} ‘there’. The two analyses and the reading chosen by one of the consultants for the clauses in ({\ref{Example_11.105}) require further investigation.

Question 243:
You are a linguist specializing in Papuan Malay. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): de ___ di situ
Gloss (with missing item): 3SG ___ at L.MED
The English translation of this sentence is:‘he (was) still there’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Definite or identifiable existential clauses also co-occur with prepositional phrases, such as the \isi{locational} phrase \textitbf{di situ} ‘there’ in ({\ref{Example_11.105}). This clause can be analyzed in two ways. One analysis is that of an \isi{existential clause} with a \isi{locational} adjunct which gives additional information about the theme’s current location. This analysis is substantiated by the contrastive example in ({\ref{Example_11.106}), in which \textitbf{situ} ‘\textsc{l.med}’ is fronted to the clause-initial position. This possibility of fronting the \isi{prepositional phrase} is typical for adjuncts. In ({\ref{Example_11.106}) the fronting serves to emphasize the location (concerning the rather common \isi{elision} of \isi{locative} \textitbf{di} ‘at’, see §\ref{Para_10.1.5}). An alternative analysis of ({\ref{Example_11.105}) is that of a \isi{prepositional predicate clause} with progressive reading. This analysis is substantiated with the (near) contrastive examples in ({\ref{Example_11.107}) to ({\ref{Example_11.109}). The example in ({\ref{Example_11.107}) presents a non\isi{verbal clause} in which \textitbf{di situ} ‘there’ serves as the predicate.

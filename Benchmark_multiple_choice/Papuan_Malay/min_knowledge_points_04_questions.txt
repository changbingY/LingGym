Question 0:
You are a linguist specializing in Papuan Malay. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): jadi saya, saya deng sa pu ___ tinggal di ruma
Gloss (with missing item): so 1SG 1SG with 1SG POSS ___ stay at house
The English translation of this sentence is:Plurality: ‘so I, I and my younger siblings stayed at the house’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Reduplication of content words is demonstrated with the three examples in (\ref{Example_4.3}) to (\ref{Example_4.5}). Reduplication of a \isi{noun} is illustrated in (\ref{Example_4.3}); in this context reduplicated \textitbf{ade} ‘younger sibling’ conveys plurality. The utterance in (\ref{Example_4.4}) includes a reduplicated \isi{verb}; in this context, \textitbf{lari} ‘run’ expresses \isi{continuation}. And the elicited example in (\ref{Example_4.5}) illustrates \isi{reduplication} of an ad\isi{verb}; in this context \isi{prohibitive} \textitbf{jangang} ‘\textsc{neg.imp}, don’t’ denotes \isi{intensity}. The three examples illustrate only three of the different meanings expressed with \isi{reduplication}. Depending on the context, a reduplicated \isi{noun} can also signal \isi{repetition}, to name just one other meaning aspect. Along similar lines, a reduplicated \isi{verb} can also express \isi{aimlessness}, among other meanings. This variety of different meanings is discussed in detail in §\ref{Para_4.2}.

In this context, the reduplicated nouns receive a stative verbal rather than a nominal reading.

In addition, the corpus contains one example in which a non-\isi{kinship term}, namely the common \isi{noun} \textitbf{rawa} ‘swamp’, undergoes a similar \isi{interpretational shift}, receiving the stative verbal reading in \textitbf{rawa{\Tilde}rawa} ‘be swampy’, as shown in (\ref{Example_4.20}).

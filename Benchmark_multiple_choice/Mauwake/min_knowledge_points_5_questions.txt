Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The switch-reference system (\sectref{sec:8.2.3}) basically tracks the subject \REF{ex:5:x921}.\footnote{Roberts maintains that in Amele and most other Papuan languages the switch reference system tracks the thematic notion of topic across clauses (\citeyear[105]{Roberts1988b}, \citeyear{Roberts1997}).

Gloss (with missing item): ___ other 3s.GEN house face=LOC there pig many 3.DAT be-PA.3s
The English translation of this sentence is: `Another man has many pigs there in front of his house.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Because the possessee is typically inanimate and often indefinite whereas the possessor is huits gloss ___ and definite, this causes a violation to the universal discourse-pragmatic principle, according to which animate/huits gloss ___ and definite participants tend to precede inanimate and indefinite participants \citep[135]{Heine1997}. In order to follow the principle, Mauwake often makes the possessor a theme by moving the possessor noun phrase to sentence-initial position. Only the dative pronoun keeps its position immediately preceding the verb \REF{ex:5:x972}. If there is no other possessor \textstyleAcronymallcaps{np}, an unmarked pronoun is used as a theme \REF{ex:5:x973}. In these two sentences, moving part of the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{np} to the theme position causes the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{np} to be non-contiguous. In the example \REF{ex:5:x595} the possessee subject \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{aaya} `sugar' is also the theme, and in \REF{ex:5:x1323} the possessee is animate/huits gloss ___, so in those clauses there is less pressure to make the possessor into the theme.

Sentence (with missing item): I urupa ___ i soomia wia, i epira marew.
Gloss (with missing item): 1p.UNM cup ___ 1p.UNM spoon no 1p.UNM plate no(ne)
The English translation of this sentence is: `We had no cups, no spoons, no plates.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The existential (\sectref{sec:5.5.1}) and possessive clauses (\sectref{sec:5.5.2}) are different from the other verbal clauses with regard to negation. Besides the standard verbal negation they can use all the other negators as well \REF{ex:5:x982} \REF{ex:5:x983} (\sectref{sec:6.2.1}). The verb \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{ik}- `be' is retained only with the verbal negator \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{me}. With all the other negators the negator itself replaces the verb, and the clause becomes a verbless clause:
A: word: weetak	 gloss: no
B: word: weetak-eya	 gloss: no-2/3s.DS
C: word: opora	 gloss: talk
D: word: -weetak/wia	 gloss: -no

The English translation of this sentence is: `Now it doesn't take place (any more), decorating them and escorting them for them (i.e. escorting girls to their prospective husbands).'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Neutralization of tense or aspect distinctions, as well as the loss of other than just one argument are common features associated with nominalization \citep[737--738]{HopperEtAl1984}. In Mauwake the nominalized verb forms may keep all of the derivational suffixes but not the inflectional ones, which include tense and person/number marking \REF{ex:5:x1226}.
A: word: nena	 gloss: 2s.GEN
B: word: akua-aaw-om-owa	 gloss: shoulder-take-BEN-NMZ

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Verbal groups showing aspect may be nominalized as well, so the aspectual distinction is retained \REF{ex:5:x1841}:
A: word: oposia	 gloss: meat
B: word: muf-em-ik-om-a-mik	 gloss: pull-SS.SIM-be-BEN-BNFY2.PA-1/3p

The English translation of this sentence is: `I won't come.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The nominalized verb in itself is neutral in regard to modality, even if it often gets deontic interpretation. But it can be, and frequently is, used in cases where modality is intentionally left unspecified. In \REF{ex:5:x1257} the reason for not coming may be that one is not allowed, or able, or willing, to come.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The distribution of finite clauses nominalized only with a demonstrative is more restricted than that of clauses with a nominalized verb.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The distribution of finite clauses nominalized only with a demonstrative is more restricted than that of clauses with a nominalized verb. They function as complement clauses \REF{ex:5:x1260} (\sectref{sec:8.3.2}), relative clauses \REF{ex:5:x1261} (\sectref{sec:8.3.1}), or temporal clauses \REF{ex:5:x1940} (\sectref{sec:8.3.3.1}), but not in the many other specific functions where the other type can occur. Forming complement clauses and relative clauses by adding a demonstrative pronoun after a finite verb is a common strategy in Papuan languages (\citealt{Reesink1983b}; \citeyear[228]{Reesink1987}; \citealt[77]{Farr1999}; \citealt[192]{Whitehead2004}).
A: word: ikiw-i-mik	 gloss: go-Np-PR.1/3p

C: word: p-ikiw-i-yan''	 gloss: BPX-go-Np-FU.1p
D: word: ek-i-ya	 gloss: go-NP-PR.3s

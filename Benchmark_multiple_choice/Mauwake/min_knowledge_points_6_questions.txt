Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Locative deixis, which relates the location to the speech act participants, utilizes several different word classes.

The distal-1 demonstrative \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{nain} `that' and the adverb \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{nan} `tits gloss ___' are more neutral, and the less common distal-2 and -3 deictics have other defining features besides the distance to the speaker.

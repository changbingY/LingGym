Question 61:
You are a linguist specializing in Mauwake. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): Naap ma-emi ___ na.
Gloss (with missing item): thus say-SS.SIM ___ INTJ
The English translation of this sentence is: `Say like that and wail.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The second person future tense form is also used for a command, but this is not very common. It is used in a specific situation, not for giving generic commands or rules. The sentence \REF{ex:7:x1080} was said to a person who was suspected of lying, and in \REF{ex:7:x1081} parents give instructions to their daughter how to mourn.
A: word: eliwa=ki	 gloss: good=CF.QM
B: word: om-em-ika-i-nan	 gloss: cry-SS.SIM-be-Np-FU.2s
C: word: mua=iw	 gloss: man=LIM
D: word: om-em-ika-i-n	 gloss: cry-SS.SIM-be-Np-PR.2s
Please only return the letter (A–D). Do not say anything else.
Correct Answer: B
